V
THE NEW LEARNING AND OBSCURANTISM

Johann Reuehlin‚ 1455-11522, the famous Hebrew scholar, became
involved in a controversy with Johann Pfefferkorn, a Jew baptized in
Koln 1506, in regard to the desirability of confiscating and destroy-
ing the books of the Jews. Reuehlin demurred Oct. 1510, and
defended himself in his ‘Augenspiegel ’. lt was condemned by the
theologians of Κὸ111, Ortwin Gratius among them; and Reuchlin
was summoned to appear before Hochstraten as Inquisitor-General,
Sept. 1513. He appealed to Leo X, who referred the case to the
Bishop of Speier; and in March 1514 the Bishop gave sentence in
favour of Reuehlin. It was now Hochstraten’s turn to appeal to the
Pope3 but by this time ‘the original dispute . . . had merged into
a contest between the New Learning and scholasticism ', and ‘the
matter had been practically settled by public opinion ’. 111 March
1514, Reuehlin‚ to show that the weight of learned opinion was on
his side, published a volume of Clarorum Virorum E pz'sz‘olae missac
ad Iohannem Reuehlin. It occurred c. 1515-7 to Crotus Rubianus
(Johann Jaeger, 1486—†1540) and Ulrich von Hutten, 1488—†1523, to
let off their wit at Obscurantism by means of a ‘similar collection
of letters ’ prosessedly ‘addressed to Ortwin Gratius by sympathizing
members of his university circle ⁷. But ‘the real importance of the
[No. 5] Epistolae obscurorum Virorum (Hullcm' Operum Sus>-
fflementum, i. 226 sq„ ed. Bocking, Lipsiae, 1864) lay in its success
in popularizing the conception of “ a stupid party ’' which was
opposed to the party of progress’ (Creightom Hz'slory osthe passaw,
vi. 56, ed. 1897; cf. Beard, Affarlin Lullter, 109 sqq„ 325, ed. 1896).
Luther alludes to the Epz'stolae but slightingly. He spoke of them
as the work of a ‘ Hans Wurst ⁹.

No. 5. From the Epistolae obscurorum Virorum.

Henricus Schaffsmulius Magistro Ortuino Gratio salutem
plurimam dicit. Cum priusquam ambularem ad Curiam,
dixistis mihi quod saepe debeo vobis scribere et aliquando
debeo dirigere aliquas quaestiones theologicales ad vos: tunc
vultis mihi eas solvere melius quam curtisani Romae. Ergo
nunc quaero dominationem vestram quid tenetis de eo,
quando unus in die Veneris, id est feria sexta, vel alias quando
est ieiunium, comedit ovum et est pullus intus? Quia nuper
in Campo Florae sedimus in uno hospitio et fecimus colla-
tionem et comedimus ova: et ego aperiens ovum vidi quod
iuvenis pullus est in eo: et ostendi socio meo, tuno ipse
dixit: ‘Comedatis cito antequam hospes videt, quia quando
videt, tunc oportet ei dare unum Carlinum vel Iulium pro
gallina': quia hic est consuetudo quod quando hospes ponit
