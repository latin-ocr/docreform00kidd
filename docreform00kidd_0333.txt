PROTESTANTISM, 1532-41 305

advantage of holding the Council in an Italian city. Accordingly
it was summoned by a Bull of 4 June 1536 (Raynaldus, Annales,
xiii. 411) to Mantua; and, when that proved abortive, by a second
of 8 Oct. 1537 (ibid. 462) to Vicenza: and a new spirit evincecl
itself in the Court of Rome with the publication, 1538, of a [No. 126]
Consilium delectorum cardinalium de emendanda ecclesia
(Le Plat, Monumenta Tridentina, ii. 596 sqq.). At this point, how-
ever, the Emperor's preoccupations stood in the way. There were
wars with the Turi< in the East, 1532 and 1539 ; there were expedi-
tions to Tunis, 1535, and to Algiers‚ 1541 ς there was a second war
with Francis, from 1536 10 18 June 1538, the Pacification of Nice
(Dumont, IV. ii. 169); there was a revolt in the Netherlands,
1539-40, before Charles was once more free to attend to the reform
of the Church.

These preoccupations left the Protestants at liberty to pursue
pians of their own (cf. Seckendorf, Historia Lutlzemnismz, III. viii,
§31). In 1532 the three princes of Anhalt-Dessau, John †1551‚
George †1553, and Joachim †1561, brought Nicholas Hausmann,
11538, as preacher to Dessau, and the country became Protestant
by 1534 (Ranke, Ref. 720). So too in 1534 Protestantism triumphed
in Nassau; and in the important cities of Hannover, Frankfurt-
am· -Main and, 22 July, Augsburg. ΓΙ16 year 1534 also saw the
defection of two larger territories—(fz) Vt iirttemberg, and (b)
Pomerania. ἲ

(a) By the peace of Kadan, 29 June 1534 (Dumont, IV. ii.
119), Wiirttemberg became Protestant under the restored Duke
Ulrich, 1534—†50. Its conversion was of importance‚ not merely
because it drove a wedge of Lutheranism into Upper Germany,
but also because its two reformers, Ambrose Blaurer, 1492-†1564‚
and Erhard Schnepf‚ 1495- 11558, representing respectively the
Bucerian and the strictly Lutheran type of Protestantism, 11616
united by, 2 Aug. 1534, the Concord of W iirttemberg upon a
doctrine of' the Eucharist to the effect that‘ Corpus et sanguinem
Christi vere, i. 6. substantialiter et essentialiter, non autem quanti-
tative aut qualitative vel localiter, praesentia esse et exhiberi m
Coena’ (Ranke, Res. 718).

(b) Pomerania, upon the death of Duke George‚ 1523—*i31‚
became by the agreement of Kalnmin, Aug. 1534, between his son
Duke Philip, 1531- †60, of lo·mme1n- VVolgast, and his brother

The reformation was established there by a Recess of the Diet at
Treptow, 13 Dec.· ‚ and by a Visitation, followed by a Church
Ordinance (Richter, Kzrclcencmz'mcn‘b σω i. 248 sqq.) from Bugen-
hagen, 1535 (Ranke, qu. 721).

Α temporary check, it is true, was put to this progress by the
disrepute which the reformation incurred from its connexion
with the Anabaptists of Munster (Ranke, [eff. 724). But 1111611
