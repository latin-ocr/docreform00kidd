46 THE DISPUTATION AT LE1PZIG, 1519 24

No. 24. The thirteenth of Eck's and of Luther's
Theses, March and May, 1519.

(1) Romanam ecclesiam non fuisse superiorem aliis ecclesiis
ante tempora Sylvestri negamus. Sed eum qui sedem beatis—
simi Petri habuit et fidem, successorem Petri et Vicarium
Christi generalem semper agnovimus.

(2) Romanam ecclesiam esse omnibus aliis superiorem pro-
batur ex frigidissimis Romanorum Pontificum decretis, intra
quadringentos annos natis 3 contra quae sunt historiae appro-
batae mille et centum annorum, textus Scripturae divinae et
decretum concilii Niceni omnium sacratissimi.

No. 25. The letter of George‚ Duke of Saxony,
to the Chaucellor of Leipzig.

We have received your esteemed letter, and from it we gather
that Your Grace is not inclined to permit the disputation which
Dr. Eck wished to hold with us and the theologians of our
University, but that you intend to prevent it, warned, as you
yourself write, in plain letters from Rome, though no charges
or injunctions have come frorn His Holiness.

At this we are not a little surprised. We were always of
opinion that our University was a place for all kinds of study,
where any one might discuss and propound what he liked,
salva tamenfide catlzolz'ca‚against which nothing too blasphemous
should be argued. So, e. g., there have been held in Leipzig
many disputations about the T1·inity‚ the Sacrament of the
Eucharist, and other articles of the Faith. No one has been
refused, nor has any final judgement been delivered which is
against the Christian Faith, thank God, nor ever shall be, God
willing.

With regard to the question whether the soul is raised to
heaven as soon as the penny rings in the dish, we were of
opinion that permission should be given for a disputation to
take place; that a final conclusion should be corne to on the
subject, whereby the poor layman should no longer be ignorantly
deceived 3 and that it ought not to be wrong to grant the
wishes of those to whom it is of the most vital importance.
We would not, however, suppose that the present course is
being taken on your Grace’s initiative . . . but we hold that
your Grace is being worked upon by those who, perhaps, are
rather afraid of being disturbed in their idleness and drinking-
bouts, such as our theologians whom we have heard reported
