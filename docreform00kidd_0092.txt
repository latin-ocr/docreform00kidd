64 THE THREE TREATISES OF 1520 35

consecration in us than pope or bishop can give, no priest
could ever be made by the consecration of pope or bishop,
nor could he say the mass or preach or absolve. Therefore
the bishop’ 5 consecration is just as if m the name of the whole
congregation he took one person out of the community; each
member of which has equal power, and commanded him to
exercise this power for the rest: in the same way as if ten
brothers, co-heirs as kings sons, were to choose one from
among them to rule over their inheritance, they would all of
them still remain kings and have equal power, although one
is ordered to govern.

And to put the matter more plainly, if a little company
of pious Christian laymen were taken prisoners and carried
away to a desert, and had not among them a priest consecrated
by a bishop, and were there to agree to elect one of them . . .
and were to order him to baptise, to celebrate the mass, to
absolve and to preach, this man would as truly be a priest‚
as if all‘ the bishops and all the popes had consecrated him.
T hat is why, in cases of necessity, every man can baptise and
absolve, which would not be possible if we were not all priests.
This great grace and virtue of baptism and of the Christian

estate they have quite destroyed and made us forget by their ” ¹

ecclesiastical law . . .

Since then the temporal power is baptized as we are, and
has the same saith and Gospel, we must allow it to be priest
and bishop, and account its office an office that is proper and
useful to the Christian community. For w·hatever' lssues from
baptism may boast that it has been consecrated priest‚ bishop,
and pope, although it does not beseem every one to exercise
these offices. For, since we are all priests alike, no man may
put himself forward or take upon himself without our consent
and election, to do that which we have all alike power to do.
For if a thing is common to all, no man may take it to himself
without the wish and command of the community. And if
it should happcn that a man were appointed to one of these
offices and deposed for abuses, he would be just what he was
before. Theresore a priest should be nothing in Christendom
but a functionary3 as long as he holds his office, he has
precedencc of others: if he is deprived of it, he is a peasant
or a citizen like the rest. Therefore a priest is verily no
longer a priest after deposition. But now they have invented
characteres t'ndelihiles, and pretend that a priest after deprivation
still differs from a simple layman. They even imagine that
