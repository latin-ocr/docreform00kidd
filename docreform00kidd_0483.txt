 

212 THE ANABAPTISTS IN zemeri, 1525-32 455

(ii) From Kessler, Sabbata.—Wolfgang Uolimann met
Conrad Grebel on the way to Schaffhausen, and by him was
so highly instructed in anabaptism that he would not simply
have water poured upon him from a dish but, entirely naked‚
was thrust down and covered over in the Rhine.

(iii) Fragment of tlze trial os Dr. Hz'ibmazler of Il'czldslmt.—
He [Hiibmaier] said, moreover, that William Roubli of
Wytikon it was who introduced baptism 3 then how, when he
was at Waldshut, he came to him, and informed him for what
God was preparing him. William had brought several citizens
with him: and went with them to a hamlet over yonder, and
baptized them. Afterwards they came to him and said, Why
did not he also take the thing in hand? But he declined and
put the matter off till Easter 3 and, as the custom was then to
hallow the font, he omitted it. Then came William and
baptized him3 and sixty persons were baptized at the same
time with him. Afterwards, during Easter‚ he himself baptized
some three hundred peoplc. . . .

No. 213. The Council orders Anabaptists to be
drowned, 7 March 1526.

(i) From their mandate ‘to be publl'slzed (m Stmquv iu the·
tlcree parislzes' [Egli, p. 445].—uWhereas our Lords the Burgo-
master, Council‚ and Great Council, have for some time past
earnestly endeavoured to turn the misguided and erring Ana-
baptists from their errors, and yet several . . . to the injury of
the public authority and the magistrates as well as to the ruin
of the common welfare and of right Christian living, have
proved disobedient 3 and several of them, men, women, and
girls, have been by our Lords sharply punished and put into
prison: Now therefore, by the carnest commandment, edict,
and warning of our Lords aforesaid, it is ordered that no one
in our town, country, or domains, whether man, woman, or
girl, shall baptize another: and if any one hereafter shall
baptize another, he will be seized by our Lords and, according
to the decree now set forth, will be drowned without mercy.
Wherefore every one knows how to order himself, and to take
care that he bring not his own death upon himself.

(ii) From a letter of Zfesiugli so soachl'm W'ata 7 March,
1526.>
