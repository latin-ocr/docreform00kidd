PROTESTANTISM, 1532—41 307

King of Poland, 1506—†48. But his persona! inclination was
towards reform, though of his own type<—‘ Ι 3111 as little disposed,’
said he, ‘ to be bound to the Church of Wittenberg as to the Church
of Rome : for I do not say Credo Sanctam Romanam or nitten-
bergensem but catholicam ecclesiam 3 and my church here in Berlin-
Koln is just as true a Christian church as the church of Wittenberg '
(ap. Pastor, Reum'onsbeslrebungen, 163). He was seconded by
nobles and towns (Heidemann‚ 208) as well as by one of the three
bishops of the Mark‚ Matthias von Jagow, Bishop of brandenburg,
1526—†44. The others resisted‚ Busso von Alvensleben‚ Bishop of
Havelberg‚ 1522—†48, and George von Blumenthal, Bishop of Lebus,
1523—†50. Joachim summoned 3 coinmission of divines‚ among
them Melanchthon and Duke George's counsellor, the Erasmian
George Witzel‚ 1501—†73 (Pastor, Remilonsbestrcbzmgen‚ 140 sqq.)
to consider the situation. In October 1539 they resolved upon a
[No. 130] conservative programme of reform (cf. Letters in
C. R. iii. 522, 789 sq„ 803). The signal for its adoption was the
Elector’s reception‚ 1 Nov. 1539, of the Sacrament in both kinds at
Spandau (Heidemann‚ 214): followed, 2 Nov.‚ by the same pro-
ceeding on the part of his people in Berlin (ibid. 215). On 1 March
1540, after consulting Lutlier (de Wette‚ v. 232), the nobles and
towns in the Diet‚ but not the spiritualty‚ admitted 3 Church
Ordinance (Sehhng, iii. 28 sqq.), which professedly left the door open
for the retention of episcopacy, and kept much of the old worship.
It was accepted, 24 July 1541, by the Emperor (Riedel, Codex 0ιῷιό-
malicus Bramlenburgensis, ΙΙ. vi. 468 sqq.), and followed up by a
Visitation, 1540-2. But the Bishops of Havelberg and Lebus
entered 3 protest (Heidemann‚ 224), and even Matthias of Branden-
burg, 10 July 1540, had to write to the Elector requesting that his
‘ episcopal rights and jurisdiction might not be abridged ’ (Riedel,
III. iii. 480). Episcopal authority soon proved inconipatible with
the new regime : and it was denounced as ‘ tyranny ’ by the
preachers (ibid. I. ix. 462). In 1543 consistories and superinten-
dents took the place of bishops with the Elector as summus episcopus
(Heidemann‚ 261). The Chapters died out. The Sees were
apssffiplrmigxtve {gAEethglngpllzlemOfffip efisaffighll 1525), tihierle34t)ook place in
the presence of Melanchthon and Butzer, with the consent of Luther
(C. R. iii. 862), the bigamous marriage of Philip oi Hesse. ‘ Defe-
ctionem etiam‚’ writes Melanchthon (ibid. 1079), ‘minitabatur si nos
consulere ei nollemus.’ It detached Philip from the League:
and forced him into a secret compact‚ 13 June 1541, with the
Emperor. The progress of Protestantism was thus suddenly

stayed.
