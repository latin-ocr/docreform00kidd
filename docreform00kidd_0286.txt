258 THE DIET OF AUGSBURG, 1530 113

ensuing, to hold the same in our Imperial City of Augsburg:
by which time we hope that we shall have settled affairs in
Italy so as to be present in person on that day, as we have
finally resolved to do. This day, then, we hereby announce
to you, our Well-beloved‚ commanding you by the authority
of our Roman Empire and by the duty wherewith you are
bound to us and to the Empire, straitly bidding and willing
you to appear that day in person at Augsburg, and together
with us and other our Electors‚ Princes‚ and Estates of the
Holy Empire, whom we have summoned in like manner, to
assist in undertaking, debating, resolving, and concluding how
weighty provision may be made for the removal of the grievous
burden and invasion into Christendom of the aforesaid Turks,
with good deliverance‚ defence‚ and steady help according to
need, in addition to the measures formerly taken in that
behalf: and, further, how, in the matter of errors and divi-
sions concerning the holy saith and the Christian religion we
may and should deal and resolve, and so bring it about, in
better and sounder fashion, that divisions may be allayed,
antipathies set aside, all past errors left to the judgement of
our Saviour, and every care taken to give a charitable hearing
to every man’s opinions, thoughts, and notioris, to understand
them, to weigh them, to bring and reconcile men to a unity
in Christian truth, and to dispose of everything that has not
been rightly explained or treated of on the one side or the
other. . . .

No. 114. The advice of Dr. Briick, March 1530.

Inasmuch as His Imperial Majesty’s summons desires that
every man's opinion and mind should have a hearing, it ap-

pears to us a good thing that the opinion wherein our side
has hitherto stood and persisted, should be duly collected ’

together in writing with well—grounded justification of the
same from Holy Scripture, so that one may have it ready
in writing to start with: since it is hardly likely that, in the
handling of the affair, the preachers as well as the Estates will
be allowed to take part. . . .

No. 115. The Proposition 01· speech from the
Throne, 20 June 1530.

et intellexerit, dissidium hoc indies augeri et latius propagari ³ '
