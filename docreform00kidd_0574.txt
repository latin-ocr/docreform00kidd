546 FAREL AND CALVIN ΙΝ GENEVA, 1536-ss

Lausanne (ibid. No. 662); but, out of 40 Religious Houses and
337 Secular Clergy invited (ibid. No. 573, n. 16) to the Disputation,
some 80 Religious and above 120 Seculars (ibid. No. 662, n. 3)
conformed. The new system began with the founding of the Uni-
versity of Lausanne, Jan. 1537 (ibid. No. 603), and was afterwards
organized by [No. 281] Synods at Lausanne. The first, 14 May
1537, set up seven ecclesiastical districts or ‘ Classes ’ and ordered
periodical ⁴ Colloquies ’ (Ruchat, iv. 413 sqq.). The second, March
1538 (ibid. 451 sqq.) adopted, 4 April, the ceremonies and ‘ the four
feasts ', other than Sunday, in use at Bern (Herminjard, iv, No. 698).
In Sept. 1539 all priests who still declined 'to conform were deprived
and banished (Ruchat, iv. 477).

(ii) Returning to Geneva, Farel resumed the project which, in,
24 July 1536, [No. 282] the case of Jean Balard (Calv. Op. xxi.
[= C. R. xlix] 203: Journal du Syndic Jean Balard ap. Me'moz'res
et Documents publids par la Socidtd &Histoire de Geneva, X. lxvii,
n. 1) ; cf. H. D. Foster, Am. Hist. Rev. viii. 231 sqq.), had already
met with some success, of restraining the citizens in the use of
their new-found libertieS. Restraint from Magistrates was one
thing 3 a mediaeval city was well accustomed to it (cf. J. M. Vincent‚
E uropecm Blue Laz sin Report qullee American Hz'storical A Μυσία
t2'‚0n 1897, pp. 357 sqq), and‘ in Geneva such legislation ante-
dated not only Calvin but the Reformation’ (Foster, ut sup. 231,
n. 4). But restraint from Ministers was another—a new ecclesi-
astical tyranny, whereas the old had but just been shaken off.
Following up the vote of 21 May 10ί live according to the Gospel',
it was ordered, says the Register of the Councils, ‘pour l'unite' (16
la ville, et afin d’ un1r les citoyens dans la foi en Christ’ (ap. Rilliet
et Dusour, Le Ρφευιιεν Cata 'ilzzsme anfazs de Calvim xiii), that
articles be drafted. On 10 Nov [N.o 283] Farel's Articuli de
regimine ecclesiae (Cale κ. Op. xxi. [= C. R. xlix.] 206) were
adopted: but they appear to have been too merely destructive to
be related to the constructive scheme of reform outlined by Calv' 1n
from llze lnstzlutes in, 13 Jan. 1537, [No. 284] a memorandum of
the Ministers of Geneva to the Council (Opera, xa[= C. R.
xxxviii] 5 sqq. Herminjard, iv, No. 602). In this memorandum
the ministers, taking as their standard the weekly Eucharist, the
discipline and the catechetical instruction of the primitive Church,
proposed to make every citizen of Genera a monthly communicant,
and, to that end, a Christian under sear of excommunication. On
16 Jan. [N 0. 0285] 1116 Two Hundred accepted the memorandum
with modifications (Op ·ι,ντ xxi. [= C. R. xlix.] 206), and at the
elections of 4 Feb. their action 11 as endorsed by the appointment of
four Syndics favourable to the preachers (z’ssbzd 207). There then
appeared, by 17 Feb (Herminjard, iv, No. 634, nn. 3, 4) from
(opera, xxli. [= C. R. 1.] 11) the pen of Calvin a Catechism1‚
