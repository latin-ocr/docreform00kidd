And for the sake of good order and discipline in going up,
not men and women together but the women after the men,
men and women should have separate places in different parts
of the church. As to private confession, Ι have already written
enough about that: and my opinion may be found in the
little prayer—book.

[l] The elevation we desire not to abolish but to retain, for
it fits in well with the Sanctus in German, and means that
Christ has bidden us to think of Him. Just as the sacrament
is bodily elevated and yet Christ‘s body and blood therein are
invisible, so through the word of the preacher He is com-
memorated and uplifted, and in the reception of the sacrament
recognized and worshipped: and yet it is all a matter of saith
and not of sight, how Christ gave His body and blood for us
and still daily intercedes with God to bestow His grace
upon us.

So much for daily Divine Service and for teaching the Word
of God, specially with a view to influencing the young and
alluring the simple. Those who come out of curiosity and the
desire to gape at something new will soon be sick and tired of
the whole thing, as they were before of Divine Service in Latin.
For that was sung and read in church daily, and yet the
churches are deserted and empty: and already they are
prepared to do the same with the German Service. So it is
best that such Divine Service should be arranged with an eye
to the young and to those simple folk that may perhaps come
to it. As for the rest, no law nor order, exhortation nor
driving, that one can devise, is of any good to induce them to
go willingly and of their own accord to Divine Service, so
unwilling and reluctant are they to do so (though God takes
no pleasure in forced service), so idle and good-for-nothing.

As for feast-days, such as Christmas‚ Easter, Whitsuntide,
Michaelmas‚ Purification and the like, we must go on, as
hitherto, with Latin till we have hymns enough in German for
the purpose. The work is but beginning, and all that belongs
