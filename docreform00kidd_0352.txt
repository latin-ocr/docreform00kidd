324 THE LU'rHERANIZING OF DENMARK, 131

No. 131. The Seizurer the Bgshops of Denmark‚
12 ug. 153 .

After Ι had written yesterday the enclosed letter to Your
Grace and had sent Your Grace's four ships home, I was not
able to come to an agreement with my sailors as to their pay,
as they did not wish to accept Danish coin on leaving. And
whilst I was in treaty with thern about it, His Royal Majesty
sent a summons for me to appear at his Council, where
Colonels of the Landsknecht5‚ Generals, 'and Cavalry Officers,
with Herr Johann Rantzau and Melchior Rantzau, were present,
and had consulted how His Royal Majesty should proceed
with his cause, because the bishops would do nothing at all as
to the payment of the cavalry and infantry. It was therefore,
in God's name, determined immediately to take the bishops by
the head, which was to be done, in all secrecy, at night, so
that to-day quite early at 4 am. the three Bishops of Sjalland ¹,
Skaane2, and Ribe3 were arrested by the Provost and the
LandsknechtS‚ and forthwith lodged in the castle at Copenhagen‚
each under a guard of Archers and Yeomen of the Guard‚ in
separate rooms. At the same moment that they were taken,
Copenhagen was put under guard by land and sear so that no
one could go out or corne in without special permission.

This went on until the third day at 8a.m. when His Royal
Majesty summoned to himself at the Castle the other members
of the Council, Herr Magnus Goye, Herr Ove Lunge, Herr
Magnus Gyldenstjerne‚ Erik Krummedige, Mester Johann
Friis‚ &c., and also the Bishop of Aarhus 4, for the consideration
of this affair. Those who now agreed with the King and the
aforenamed Councillors were in no danger, and those „who did
not were to be at once arrested ς but Ι think they will all
give in.

In the meantime, the King will not decide finally on the
alterations in the government before the appointed Rigsdag,
of which Ι bave spoken in my first letter. Meanwhile, His
Majesty will summon his nobles and friends, including Your
Grace, to the Council about this matter. The other old
Councillors‚like Herr Anders Bilde‚ Herr Johann Urne, &c., who
have been imprisoned at Mecklenburg, will, according to the

¹ Joakim Ro'nnov, Bishop of Roskilde, 1512-36. He appears not to
have been seized till next day. [See below]

² Torbern Bilde‚ Archbishop of Lund, 1532-6.

³ Olaf Munk‚ Coadjutor of Iwar Munk‚ Bishop of Ribe, 1513-†39.
⁴ Ove Bilde‚ Bishop of Aarhus, 1520—36.
