62 LUTHER AND ULRICH VON HUTTEN, 1520 34

Etiam Turcae minus oderint, nec ulli ethnici calumniandi ut
prius occasionem habebunt : hactenus enim eorum qui religioni
praefuerunt, vitae turpitudo odibile apud alienos Christianum
nomen reddidit . . . Ex Ebernburgo, tertia Idus Septembres.

XVIII
THE THREE TREATISES OF 1520

On 12 Jan. 1519 Maximilian died, and on 27 June his grandson
Charles V was elected Emperor, 1519-56. Charles was born at
Ghent‚ 1500, and succeeded to a vast inheritance, which included
the Netherlands and Burgundy, Spain, Austria‚ Naples, Sicily,
and Sardinia, with the New World. He was thus a prince of
German blood, who added unwonted resources to the imperial
crown. He was also reputed to be favourable to reform. Thus,
when, early in 1520 (de Wette, i. 421), Eck was in Rome busy
with the proceedings that ended in the Bull of Excommunication,
issued on 15 June, Luther addressed himself to ‘the young and noble
sovereign' by whom ⁶ God has roused great hopes in many hearts ',
in a treatise of August 1520, entitled [No. 35] To the Christian
Nobility of the German Nation respecting the Reformation
of the Christian Estate. It was an appeal in German directed to
the laity, urging them to take reform in hand for themselves, on the

a second treatise addressed in Latirgi to thizologl'ans [1310. 36] De
Captivitate Babylonica Ecclesiae Praeludium (Opera Lat. ν. 16
sqq). ‘In the seven sacraments with which the Church accom-
panied and controlled the life of the Christian from the cradle to
the grave, he saw nothing but an attempt to bring it all under the
power of the priest3 there was nothing but a Captivity and Rome
was ‚the modern Babylon' (Kidd, Continental Refwmaffion, 22).
A third treatise [No. 37], Concerning Christian Liberty‚ was no
polemic, but, in intention at least, an eirenicon‚ to be sent under
a covering letter to Leo X, which, though of 13 Oct. or after
(de wette, i, 497), was antedated (by a last arrangement with
Miltitz at Lichtenberg 11 Oct.) to 6 Sept., so as to seem to have
been dispatehed before the Bull of Excommunication was published
in Saxony. All three treatises are translated in Wace and Buchheim,
Lullzer’s Prz'mmy Warks, 157 sqq. (2nd ed., 1896), and are of the
first importance sor the study of the Lutheran theology.
