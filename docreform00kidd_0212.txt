184 THE DIET OF SPEIER, 1526 89

in wrsting, to your Electoral and Princely Graces and other
the worshipful Estates of the Holy Empire‚ we the representa-
tives of the Free Imperial Cities, have obediently received,
together with the articles of the Imperial Instructions concerning
our holy Christian faith.

We observe that the said articles aim specially at this, that
nothing in this Diet shall be undertaken or concluded to the
injury of our holy Christian saith or to the laws or ancient
customs of the Church, its doctrine, order, ceremonies‚ and
usages: but that these shall, in accordance with His Majesty's
Edict at Worms, be, throughout the Empire, maintained,
executed‚ and ordained to be used, with the proviso that His
Imperial Majesty will shortly repair to Rome to His Holiness
the Pope, and with him will, as is fitting, announce and pro-
claim a General Council and common assembly of Christendom.

Now we, the representatives of the Free Cities of the Empire,
willingly obedient in all subjection to His Majesty, as our
right, only, and natural iord, in all that may forward the peace
and unity of the Holy Empire, acknowledge ourselves also
bound thereto. But your Electoral and Princely Graces know
to what a great and grievous extent the errors, discords‚ and
disagreements in the matter of the aforesaid articles, especially
in respect of ceremonies and abuses, have of recent years
increased and multiplied: and how impossible it has hitherto
proved, and, as it may be presumed, will yet prove more
impossible, to execute the Imperial Edict of Worms, as lately‚
at the Diet of Nurnberg, was by your Graces resolved in reply
to the Papal Envoy.

We, therefore, the representatives of the Free Cities, doubt
not but that. . . His Imperial Majesty will himself graciously
consider that it would be extremely grievous, in the matter of
ceremonies and abuses, to persist in imposing the Edict
of Worms until a Genera] Council.

Further, the date of His Majesty's Instructions is the twenty-
third day of March last, at which time His Majesty was at one
with His Holiness the Pope. But, as we are now informed,
His Holiness has at this moment an army in the field against
His Majesty. For this and other reasons we cannot suppose that
a General Council or other common assembly of Christendom
can, as His Imperial Majesty intended, be proclaimed and
brought together. . . .
