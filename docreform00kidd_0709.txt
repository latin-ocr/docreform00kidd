Pope and to the Catholic rites enforced, and shall have resort
to violence and imbrue our hands in noble blood. For these
reasons I foresee a manifest and certain division in the
kingdom, and civil war as a consequence 3 and this will be
the cause of the ruin both of the kingdom and of religion,
because upon a change in religion a change in the State
necessarily follows.

ᾗ 3. THE NETHERLANDS
XXI
THE DUTCH REFORMED, 1559—62

On 26 October 1555 Charles V resigned the crown of the Nether-
lands to his son Philip II of Spain, 1556—†98. The Emperor left
him his debts‚ his policy of putting down heresy by Edicts and
Inquisition, and his scheme for cementing‘ the ecclesiastical unity
of the Seventeen Provincesl by an enlarged and reconstituted
hierarchy—-everything‚ in fact, but his personal popularity. In
1559 [No. 331] the Venetian Ambassador wrote that Philip
was a foreigner to the Netherlands (Calendar {gf Stasr· Papers,
Veneriam, 1558—80, No. 274). He felt himself so: and at last the
Peace of Cateau-Cambre'sis, 3 April, set him free to sail, 26 Aug,
for Spain. He left the government os the Netherlands in the hands
ofa Regent and a Minister—his half-sister leIargaret Duchess of
Parma, a native-born princess, 1521—l‘86, and the Burgundian
Antoine Perrenot de Granvellc, 1517—†86, Bishop of Arras 1538—61.
Both were regarded as the representatives of a foreign Sovereign,
and both were dependent wholly on his favour. Before his
departure, Philip, 24 May, had secured the consent of Paul IV to
[No. 332] the increase of Bishoprics (ibid. No. 75): and by
a Bull of 18 Aug. (Raynaldus, Amr. Eccl. xv. 40 sqq.) the hier-
archy was raised from four to seventeen2 sees, with Granvelle at
its head (Calendczr, No. 244) as Cardinal-Archbishop of Mechlin,
1561. There was much to be said sor this project as designed
to replace a chaos of four dioceses—Utrecht, Artas, Tournai, and
Cambrai—which were subject to the foreign metropolitains of Koln
and Rheims, by a national hierarchy. But it was resented, and
so was the repression. Discontent was of slow growth: but the
