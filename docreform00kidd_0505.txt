ξ) 2. FRENCH SWITZERLAND.
XI
FAREL, 1526—32

French Switzerland (cf. Ruchat, Histoire de la Refirmation dc
la Suissa, ii. 173 sq.‚ ed. VuHiemin, 1835) centred in Bern, a rival
011 equal terms with Savoy for dominion in the Pays de Vaud.
The Bernese, having adopted the Reformation 7 Feb. 1528 (ibid. i.
479 sqq.)‚ were anxious to extend their influence by promoting it
not only in their own four commanderies of *Aigle, Ormonts,
Onon, and Bex (ibid. i. 486 sqq), but in *Orbe‚ *Grandsom and
*Morat‚ where they exercised a joint authority with Catholic
Freiburg, and in the Counties of Valangin and Neuchatel. They
found an agent in the roving preacher Guillaume Farel. 1489-11565.
Born at Gap in Dauphine'‚ he was, like most reformers of Western
Swstzerland, a French refugee: like them, too, a humanist‚ as the
pupil and friend of Jacques Lefevre d'Etaples (Faber Stapulensis),
14 -†1 36.

ἔξω 305Νον. 1526 [No. 228] Farel began to preach at Aigle
(Herminjard, correspondance des Refformaezleurs dans les jnzys de
langue franfaise‚ i, No. 184, n. 15) in the diocese of Sion, and
sought the protection of the Bernese government(ibid. ii, No. 198).
011 22 Feb. 1527 [No. 229] Bern upheld him against an episcopal
inhibition (ibid. ii, No. 195) and afterwards sent, 1 Feb. 1528,
a herald and, 14 Feb„ letters (ibid. ii, No. 220 and 11. 5) in his
support. By 5 March a majority in [No. 230] Aigle, Ollon, and
Bex were ready to vote for the Reformation (ibid. ii, No. 222).
On the 12th [No. 231] Images and the Mass were to be put
down (ibid. n. 4), and 25 April [No. 232] the Bernese rites were
ordered to be set up in their place (ibid. ii, No. 231). In July

¹ [No. 233] Farel (ibid. ii, No. 235) and Simon Robert (ibid. ii, No.

238), as pastors of Aigle and of Bex respectively‚ were put into
possession of the benefices (ibid. ii, No. 231, n. 6).

But Farel was too useful a man to be allowed to settle at Aigle.
In 1529, after three attempts‚ Oct.-Nov. (ibid. ii, Nos. 262, 264 11. 6,
266 n. 4), 011 Lausanne, where, though supported by Bern, he was
kept at arm’s length by Sebastien de Montfaucon, the Prince-
Bishop, 1517—†60‚ he gathered about him a band of preaehers
(ibid. ii, No. 324, 11. 2) and in November appeared at [No. 234]
ΝΘιιοῙιὲιῒεΙ. His reception there (ibid. ii, No. 274) compared
favourably with, 15 Aug. 1530, his [No. 235] treatment at Valan-

l, gin (ibid. ii, No. 304, 11. 1), and led, 23 Oct. to 4 Νον. 1530, to the

[No. 236] abolition of Catholic Worship (ibid. ii, No. 317) and
to the, 4 Nov.‚ [No. 237] Recess in favour of the Reformation

¹¹ (Ruchat, ii. 516 sqq.) procured at the instance of Rern.

 

* Taken from Savoy, 1475-6.
