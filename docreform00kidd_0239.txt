Answer. We are to sear and love God, that we do not seek
to alienate or turn from our neighbour his wife, his servants, or
his cattle, but exhort them to remain and do their duty to him.

For I, tlte Lord tlzy God, am a jealons God, and visit llze
sins of tlze fathers upon tlze children meto tlze tlu‘rd andfourtlc
generaliore of tlzem that lzate lise, and show mercy anto tlzou-
sands in tlzem tlzat love Me and keep lisy commandments.

What does that mean?

Answer. God threatens to punish all who transgress these
commandments. Wherefore we must fear His wrath and not
break these commandments. But He promises His grace and
all good things to all who keep these commandments. Where-
fore we are to love and trust Him and gladly do according
to His commandments.

What does that mean?

Answer. Ι believe that God has created me and all other
creatures‚ and has given me, and preserves for me, body and
soul, eyes, ears, and all my limbs, my reason and all my
senses3 and that daily He bestows on me clothes and shoes,
meat and drink, house and home, wife and child, fields and
cattle, and all my goods, and supplies in abundance all needs
and necessities of my body and life, and protects me fron] 311
perils‚ and guards and defends me from all evil. And this
He does out of pure fatherly and Divine goodness and mercy,
without any merit or worthiness in me3 for all which Ι am
bound to thank Him and praise Him, and, moreover, to
serve and obey Him. This is a faithful saying.
