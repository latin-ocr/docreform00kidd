292 THE DIET OF AUGSBURG. 1530 117

said Catholic and true propositions and articles, it may very
easily happen that they should ask for a copy, and time in
which to answer, it would be well first to consult and deliberate
with the aforesaid Catholic Christian Princes as to what should
be done and what course should be followed in that case.
And, although I do not doubt that your Highness and the
illustrious Princes would adopt the best course and measures,
yet with all due reverence, and subject to your correction,
I will state my opinion. Your Highness must be aware that
it was, and always will be, in the nature of heretics to be
obstinate and hard, never willing to give way or consent to
reason, nor to any authority, however clear and approved.
This I am convinced will be the same with these, from the
protestation they make and propound at the beginning. For
though they try to cover it up and sosten it down with fine
words, yet it seems to me to say nothing else in the end than
that, if the matter is not settled to their liking, they mean to
persist in their opinion and in their appeal to a future Council—
not because they are to be determined‚ either as regards belief

ruled by the aforesaid doctors and theologians (which Ι (10 not
believe, and would to God I might be wrong) ,- in this case let
thern consult and deliberate as to the ways and means to be
observed and followed, and how matters should be brought to
a conclusion so that men may live in a Christian way and in
the truth of the Faith—which, if God grant us this grace, it will
then be easy to consult and deliberate upon.

The second is that of their not consenting to or accepting
the sound counsel and doctrine which shall be shown them
(which 1 greatly sear), but rather obstinately insisting upon
wishing to reply, and in these disputations and vain contro-
versies prolonging matters with a wish never to end them, as
I am sure they intend to do. In this case let your Majesty be
well advised not to consent to it, nor, on this point, to promise
or concede to them anything whatever, because you would
