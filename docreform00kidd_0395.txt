was rendering him assistance, by a further request that if we
would only allow him to negotiate a peace between the King
and us, it could be done with goodwill and good saith. An
answer is to be given to-morrow.

(e) The ambassador of Savoy also drew attention amongst
other things to the fact that the Cardinal of Sitten lay with
the Papa] troops in Savoy, a thing which could not happen
without damage to the poor people. At his request, letters
were sent to the Cardinal requiring that he should withdraw
and provision his troops elsewhere, and that those passing
through Savoy should make due payment and the people
receive no damage 3 for the Duke had already paid us a con-
siderable sum of money and had still to pay more. If then any
damage came to his subjects, it would be impossible for him to
fulfil his obligations. The envoys, who were on their way to
the Cardinal about ordnance, were also to make these repre—
sentations by word of mouth.

(f) A proposal was also introduced about the Fair of Lyons,
how to transfer it thence to Geneva. As great profits were
expected therefrom, advice was taken about it with the Em-
peror's ambassadors, They undertook to bring the matter
before His Imperial Majesty, in the hope of a gracious answer
on his part. The Spanish and Milanese ambassadors, who were
also consulted in this case, were favourable to the scheme.

(g) The Imperial ambassadors requested that we would ‘sit
down with them and make plans for a campaign against Bur-
gundy ⁷, and would also maintain a loyal regard for his Imperial
Majesty, Answer was made to them that for the present we
were too busy with other concerns and had no authority sor
this3 but that we would take their request home and make
answer at the next Diet.

(lz) ‘Whereas upon the conquest of the Duchy of Milan,
this Diet was appointed here in the town of Baden to advise
and resolve in what manner the young Duke of Milan should
be installed in the Dukedom in accordance with certain pro-
posals and conferences which took place at a former Diet in
that behalf3 and whereas at this Diet here in Baden there
have appeared their Excellencies the Imperial Ambassadors
and their Worships the Envoys of the Duchy of Milan, and
much advice has been taken in regard to the installation of
Duke Maximilian¹ 3 certain articles have at last been drawn
up, notice of the same has been given on either side, and
