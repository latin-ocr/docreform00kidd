710 THE NEW FAITH, DISCIPLINE, 351

Thy chosen people‚ may both in their life and doctrine be
found faithful, setting only before their eyes Thy glory, and
that by thern all poor sheep, which wander and go astray, may
be gathered and brought horne to Thy sold.

Moreover, because the hearts of rulers are in Thy hands, we “

beseech thee to direct and govern the hearts of all Kings,
Princes, and Magistrates, to whom Thou hast committed the
sword3 especially, O Lord, according to our bounden duty, we
beseech Thee to maintain and increase the noble estate of the
King's Majesty‚ and his honourable Council, with all the estate
and whole body of the Commonwealth. Let thy fatherly
favour so preserve him, and Thy Holy Spirit so govern his
heart, that he may in such sort execute his office, that Thy
religion may be purely maintained, manners reformed, and sin
punished, according to the precise rule of Thy holy Word.
And for that we be all members of the mystica] body of
Christ Jesus, we make our requests unto Thee, O heavenly
Father, for all such as are affiicted with any kind of cross or
tribulation‚ as war, plague, famine, sickness, poverty, imprison-
ment, persecution, banishment‚ or any other kind of Thy rods,
whether it be grief of body or unquietness of mind ,- that it
would please Thee to give them patience and constancy till
Thou send them full deliverance [out] of all their troubles.
And finally, O Lord God, most merciful Father, we most
humbly beseech Thee to show Thy great mercy upon our
brethren who are persecuted, cast in prison, and daily con-
demned to death for the testimony of Thy truth: And though
they be utterly destitute of all man’s aid, yet let Thy sweet
comfort never depart from them, but so inflame their hearts
with Thy Holy Spirit, that they may boldly and cheerfully
abide such trial as Thy godly wisdom shall appoint 3 so that at
length, as well by their death as by their life, the kingdom of
Thy Son Jesus Christ may increase and shine through all the
world: In whose name we make our humble petitions unto
Thee, as He hath taught us, saying, Our Famem &a '

ALMIGHTV and everliving God, vouchsafe, we beseech Thee,
to grant us perfect continuance in Thy lively saith, augmenting
the same in us daily, till we grow to the full measure of our
perfectiori in Christ, wherof we make our Confession, saying,
