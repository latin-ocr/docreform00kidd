72 THE MISSION or CAMPEGGIO, 1523-4 ψ

and other affairs are to be settled. Is very sorry that a diet
has been convoked at Spire, as new and greater errors and
calamities will be the only consequences of the debates which
will take place. Has therefore sent letters to the Infante
(Ferdinand), to the Regents of the Empire, to the Princes
Electors, the Estates General and provincial, and to other
persons. Encloses copies of these letters and authorizes him
to show them to the Pope. Fears, however, that these letters
will have no greater effect than his solemn edict given at
Worms, and that the diet will assemble in spite of thern. The
evil, it is to be feared, will increase so much that it will be
found impossible to eradicate it afterwards.

Two remedies only present themselves to him: either he
must go to Germany, and punish the heretics with severity, 01·
a general council must be convoked. As it is impossible for
him to go soon to Germany, he begs the Pope to decide what
he ought to do. Promises his Holiness, as a good son of the
Choreb, to stake his person and his states to suppress a sect
which is evidently dangerous to all religious authority. As the
Germans have asked the Legate‚ Cardinal Campeggio, to pro-
pose to the Pope a general council to be held in Germany, it
would be wellis his Holiness would anticipate the conventicle
at Spire by the convocation of a general council at Trent. The
Germans consider Trent as a German city, although it is,
properly speaking, Italian. Although the council ought to be
convoked at Trent early next spring, it can afterwards be
prorogued and transferred to another city in Italy ,- Rome, for
example, or wherever the Pope likes. Promises to obey the
orders of the Holy Father. . . .
