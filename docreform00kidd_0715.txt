first in EngIand, 1538, and then, 1539-40, among the Reformed of
Ziirich, Basel, and Strassburg. Returning to Scotland, 1543, he
brought with him the First Helvetic Confession (Niemeyer‚
105 sqq.) a semi-Zwinglian formulary which he afterwards translated
(Wodrow Mz'scellany, i. 11 sqq.) to serve as a confession of saith
sor congregations in Montrose, 1544, and Dundee, 1545. A Corn-
munion office, used later on by Knox at Berwick‚ 1550 (Lorimer,
John Knox and tlte Clmrclc of England, 290 sqq.) was almost
certainly from his hand, being based on that of Ziirich, with which
he had become acquainted in exile3 and &Vishart may thus be
considered the first to have planted on Scottish soil the Continental
Reformation in its Zwinglian form. He was seized at length by
Cardinal Beaton‚ and burnt at St. Andrews‚ 1 March 1546. But,
within three months, the Cardinal himself was murdered, 29 May 3
and John KnOX, 1515—†72‚ who had been with Wishart and was to
cany on his work, took refuge, with the assassins, in the Castle of
St. Andrews 10 April 1547, where he remained till, on its capitula-
tion to the French‚ 31 July‚ he was sent to the galleys in France.
The events that led to his return were the issue of that long
rivalry between the English and the French court for ascendancy
in Scotland which from, 8 Dec. 1542, [Νο. 336] the death of
James V, 1513-142 (Lindsay of Pittscottie‚ Hz'stmy cgfcs'cotland, bk.
xxi, ch. xxxix, ed. S. T. S. i. 407), centred round his daughter Mary.
Queen of Scots‚ 1543-187. 011 1 July 1543 the Earl of Arran, as
Regent‚conc1uded the treaty of Greenwich with Henry VIII for
her marriage with prince Edward. But relations between the two
countries became strained‚ and, when war ensued, 1544-6, a rival
alliance was entered into with ance, 1547, by which the Scots
were to receive help against the English troops ancl their Queen to
marry the Dauphin. ln Aug. 1548 [No. 337] Mary left horne,
to be educated in Franoe (Regisler os tlze Privy Cozmcz'l of Scot-
land, April 1550, i. 88) ; and, April 1554, the Queen-mother Mary
of Guise, 1516-†60 became Regent. On 24 April 1558 [No. 338]
bhe Queen of Scots was married to the Dauphin (gLesley,
Hz'slory of Scotlaml [Bannatyne Club] 264 sq.), and so, as wife of
Francis 11, 1559—†60, became Queen of France as well. It seemed
as if her uncles the Guises might use her high position to force
upon the country of her birth a regime at once foreign and papal.
But the reforming party had made head in the interval. The
Council of Edward VI, anxious for allies in Scotland, procured the
release of Knox, Feb. 15493 and, 28 Oct. 1552, offered him the
bishopric of Rochester (Dixon, iii. 486 11.). But he refused it. [No.
339] The Second Prayer Book of Edward VI was abhorrent
to him (W'orks, vi. 11 sq.). On the accession os Mary, he found
an asylum, for the most part, at Geneva, 1554—8, and, save sor
a brief visit to Scotland‚ Sept. 1555—July 1556, was there when
Calvin's influence stood at its height. The soil, meanwhile, was
being made ready for its receptiou into Scotland. On 6 Jan. 1540
[Νο. 340] James V warned the clergy to put their house in order
