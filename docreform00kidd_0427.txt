Our friendly greedngs, &e Whereas we lately sent you our
Commission with instructions to advise you, concerning the
innovations and abuses on the part of some who ate flesh
last Lent contrary to the accepted ordinances, customs, and
usage of the Christian Church, for the reasons given to put
thern down, and further to refrain from disparaging or abandon-
ing other accepted ordinances, Laws, and good customs of the
Christian Church, as ye have understood them this long time
past, and have been informed of the answer and the resolution
you gave to our Commission : and whereas the aforesaid laws,
ordinances, usages, traditions‚and good customs of Holy Church
are acknowledged to have so good a Christian intent that they
have been accepted of all Christian men and for many years
past have been laudahly ohserved and unanimously holden
of all Christendom, and, moreover, cannot be omitted by any
one for his own purposes without scandal and offence3 Now,
therefore, as against all this, we, on our part, do you no
otherwise to wit than that it is our fatherly faithful advice
and our friendly earnest request that ye will composc the
scandal and offenee among you by Christian and due ohedi-
ence to the ordinances and good customs of Holy Church,
and, so far as in you lies, cause them to be ohserved and done
amongst you. This we believe to 1)6 111 accordance with the

ῗρῗιρεΙ, with the teaching of Paul, and with the holy Christian
ait . . . .
