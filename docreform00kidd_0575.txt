 

FAREL AND CALVIN IN GENEVA‚ 1536—8 547

based on the Instilutes and entitled Instruction et Confession de
Foz' dont on use en l’Eglise de Geni've (in French‚ Rilliet et Dufour,
op. cit. 1 sqq. ancl Opera, xxii. [= C. R. 1.] 33 sqq. ; in Latin, 1538,
ibid. v. [= C. R. xxxiii] 317 sqq) ; and, 27 April (ibid. xxi. [= C. R.
xlix.] 210)‚‘ exlraicte de l'Instrztclz‘0n‚' whether by F arel (ibid. xxii.
[= C. R. 1.] 18) or by Calvin (Rilliet et Dufour, op. cil. lii sqq),
a [No. 286] Confession entitled Confession de la Fas, laquelle tous
bourgeois et habitans de Genbve et subja-ts du pays doibvent jarer
de garder et tenir (Opera, xxii. [= C. [ι’. 1.] 85 sqq.; in Latin, v.
[= C. R. xxxiii] 355‘sqq.), But at this point, with the attempt to
base Church-membership on individual profession and civic unity
on unity of belief, opposition began to appear: first (1) religious,
and then (2) political (cf. Ruchat, V. 52 sqq).

(1) The religious supremacy of the preachers was threatened (a)
by, 9 March 1537, [No. 287] the arrival of Anabaptists from the
Low Countries (Opera, xxi. [= C. R. xlix] 207 sqq), who challenged
Farel to adisputation‚ 16—17 March. But the Two Hundred cut it
'short and banished them 19 March. The Council could not afford
to have the authority of its preachers shaken. But (b) neither must
their orthodoxy be impugned‚ as it had been, 17 Feb„ before the
Bernese commissioners at Lausanne when [No. 288] Caroli
accused Farel and Calvin of Arianism (Herminjard, iv, No.
610). The charge was untrue. But they had given just enough
opening for it; Farel by having had for a colleague at Neuchatel
the Arian Claude d’Aliod (ibid. iii, No. 464), and both by omitting
‘ Trinity ' and ‘ Person ’ from the formularies they were now seeking
to impose on Geneva. Caroli was deposed, 7 June (ibid. iv, No.
633), and the preachers were acquitted (ibid. No. 634), but not
without, 13 Aug„ a reprimand (ibid. No. 6503 and Ruchat, ν.
499). With their credit thus re-established‚ they were strong
enough to obtain from the Councils [No. 289] decrees enforcing
the Confession‚ 28—9 July, by oath (Opera, xxi. [= C. R. xlix]
213) and, 19 Sept. and 12—15 Nov., on pain of banishment: but
these proposals were defeated, 25 Now, in the General Assembly
(ibid. 216 sq.). Baulked of civil penahies, the preachers fell back
on ecclesiastica13 but these, 3-4 Jan. 1538, in the shape of [No.
²99] excommunication (ibid. 219 sq.), even the Two Hundred
reJ(e2()t(l³dolitical events completed their overthrow. On 3 Feb. 1538
(ibid. 221) the four Syndics were elected from the popular party.
This party now looked to Bcrn where reforms had been less radical
and theology was more liberal than in Geneva ; while the Bernese
were ready to support any movement in Geneva by means of which
they could make good their claims over the too independent city
which they had rescued along with the Pays de Vaud. There, as in
the other Prince-Bishopric of Lausanne and in the Vaud, ecclesias-
tical uniformity might pave the way for political unity. Accordingly,
on 11-12 March, without consulting the ministers [No. 291] the
Genevan government voted the Bernese ceremonies (ibid.
