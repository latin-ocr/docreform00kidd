438 THE DISPUTATIONS AT zomon, 1523 197

specie omnibus porrigi debebat, sicut a Christo factum est.
Porro quod quidam e sacerdotum numero nonnisi quaestus
gratia Missam celebrant, mihi vehementer dolet, quum nimirum
opum tam cupidi sunt ut propter eas Christum vendere non
erubescant. Spero autem P. C. vos prudenti et maturo consilio
curaturos esse ut sacrifici istiusmodi missare desinant et in
pace moriantur. Satius enim erit vel duas praebendas alicui
gratis largiri, quam ut tanta abominatione Deum offendat.

Grebelms. Porro illud mihi cum primis indignum videtur,
quod sacerdotes ipsi sibi sacramentum hoc sumunt.

Zm'nglius. Unusquisque omnino Spiritu sancto dictante
illud ipse accipiat licet. Christus enim a quo illud nobis
porrigitur idem nos accipere iubet, &o . . .

No. 198. The Council’s Mandate for the abolition
of Images and of the Mass, 27 Oct. 1523.

Whereas our Gracious Lords the Burgomaster, Council‚ and
Great Council, last year, solely for the honour and praise of God
and the salvation of Christian souls‚ summoned all their parish
priestS, curateS, people's priests, and preachers‚ because of
certain misunderstandings of the Word of God 3 and whereas
of late. . . the aforesaid parish priests have been called together
from town and country, and in the matter of two articles,
Images and the Mass, have sought and found divine truth out
of the clear Word of God:

Now therefore, in the matter of Images, it is, by our Lords
aforesaid, forbidden to any one, spiritual or temporal, until
further orders (which will shortly be given, if God will, out of
the Word of God), to carry about or shift any Image in the
church should he have set up some particular Image of his own
therein. He may, however, take it into his own hands, if it
should appear that nothing unadvisable should arise from his
so doing. But, in the case of Images made by the parishioners
or out of the church funds, no change shall, for the present,
be made in respect of them, without the knowledge and consent
of the parishioners.

As concerns the Mass, things shall, till further order and
pending an explanation soon to come, remain as they are:
and no one shall utter or allege anything thereon to his
neighbour in any irritating or provocative words. And who-
soever, in word or deed, shall behave himself unmannerly
or disobediently‚ our Lords will punish him severely and
according to the circumstances of the case. . . .
