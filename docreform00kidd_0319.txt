117 THE DIET OF AUGSBURG‚ 1530 291

ea quae nunc de Christiana fide a sacerdotibus qui Chalce-
done convenerunt per nostra praecepta statuta sunt, iuxta apo-
stolicas expositiones et instituta sanctorum patrum trecentorum
decem et octo et centum quinquaginta, in hac regia Urbe defi-
nita esse noscuntur. Nam in contemptores huius legis poena
non deerit, quia non solum contra fidem vere expositam
veniunt, sed etiarn Iudaeis et paganis ex huiusmodi certamine
profanant veneranda mysteria. Igitur si clericus erit qui publice
tractare de religione ausus fuerit, a consortio clericorum remo-
vebitur3 si vero militia praeditus sit, cingulo spoliabitur: ceteri
etiarn huiusmodi criminis rei, siquidem liberi sint, de hac
sacratissima Urbe expellentur pro vigore iudiciario etiam com-
petentibus suppliciis subiugandi 5 sin vero servi, severissimis
animadversionibus plectentur.’ ¹

And inasmuch as in the aforesaid articles and propositions
it is stated that their preachers have neither preached, nor
said, nor written, many things which are attributed to thern—
which, however, is false—it is, in my opinion, advisable that
the above-mentioned doctors and theologians should note the
places where they have said, taught, and preached the contrary,
and the many contradictions and scandals disseminated in the
Church of Christ, to the destruction of quiet, peace, and holy
religion ; and, for better satisfaction, let their authorities be
adduced by our people, and let them show the true sense and
meaning which, with their erudition, will be an easy matter.
Furthermore, it would appear to me necessary for the clearer
elucidation of the truth that the aforesaid doctors should pro-
pound and set forth as against their heretical‚ false, seditious,
disorderly‚ erroneous, and scandalous articles, the true articles
and propositions——such as may be suited and attuned to the
pious ears of Catholics ; and should confirm and stablish them
by holy Scripture and the authority of holy doctors approved
by the Church.

When the said things shall have been drawn up in due and
full form, as well in German as in Latin even as was done by
thern, Ι think that the whole should be presented to your
Catholic Majesty, who, if it seem good to you, will be able to
summon all the Catholic Princes and, with their counsel and
consent, deliberate whether to convoke the whole Diet and let
these things be publicly read and understood by all.

And since, O Sacred Majesty, after the reading of the afore-

¹ Codex Iustiniani, Lib. 1, Tit. i, Lex 4 (Corp. lur. Civ. ii. 6, edd.

’ Mommsen and Kriiger). The Law is Marcian's Ediet of 452, aster the
ἴ Couneil of Chalcedon, Mansi, vii. 475.
