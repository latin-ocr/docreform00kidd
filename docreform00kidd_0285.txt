112 THE DIET oF AUGSBURG, 1530 257

which, according to his judgement, ought to be adopted. He
describes the state of affairs in the following manner :—

“In certain parts of Germany all the Christian rites which
were given to us by the ancient holy fathers have been
abrogated in accordance with the suggestions of these scoun-
drels ; the sacraments are no longer administered, vows are
not observed, marriages are contracted irregularly and within
the degrees prohibited by the laws. . . ,⁷²²

‘ He reminds the Emperor that “this sect '⁷ would not procure
him any increase of power, as he had been promised, and
assures him of his own spiritual aid in the event of his
adopting the counsels suggested :—

“And I, if there shall be need, will pursue them with
ecclesiastical censures and penalties‚ omitting nothing that
it may be needful to do. I will deprive the beneficed heretics
of their benefices, and will separate them by excommunica-
tions from the catholic flock. Your Highness also, with your
just and awful Imperial Ban, will subject them to such and
so horrible an extermination that either they shall be con-
strained to return to the holy Catholic saith, or shall be utterly
ruined ‚and despoiled both of goods and life. And if any
there be, which God forbid, who shall obstinately persevere
in that diabolical course . . . Your Majesty will then take fire
and sword in hand, and will radically extirpate these noxious
and venomous weeds. . . .

“It will be well and to the purpose that when this mag-
nificent and Catholic undertaking shall have been put firmly
and directly on its way, there should be chosen, some few
days after, efficient and holy inquisitors who, with the utmost
diligence and assiduity‚ should go about secking and inquiring
if there be any (but far be it from them) who persist in these
diabolical and heretical opinions, nor will by any means
abandon them . . . in which case they shall be castigated and
punished according to the rule and practice observed in Spain
with regard to the Moors. . . .'''
