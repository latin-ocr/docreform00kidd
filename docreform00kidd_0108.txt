80 THE DIET OF WORMS, 27 JAN.—25 MAY 1521 39

of the capitulations which Charles had signed at his election
(Goldasti Constitutimzes Impermles, ii. 141), that no proceedings
could be taken ‘sine magno scandalo contra hominem Germanum
indicta causa' (Brieger, Ale-ander und Luther, 19), and rightly
concluded that ‘et spes et ratio vincendi in Caesare tantum est'
(ibid. 27). On 3 Jan. 1521 the Pope issued a new and sharper
Bull of Excommunication (Alagnum Bull. Rom. i. 614 sqq.)‚
and, 18 Jan., addressed a Brief to the Emperor requiring him to
carry it into effect (Balan, i. 34 sqq.). But by taking the advice
of his ambassador at Rome to the effect that ‘he ought to show
some favour to a certain Friar Martin' of whom ‘the Pope is
exceedingly afraid' (12 May 1520: Calendar of State Papers, ¹
spanis-ll, ii. 305), Charles could at once secure himself against
Leo's possible defection to Francis Ι, 1515—†47‚ and also satisfy
[No. 41] the strongly anti-papal sentiment of Germany
(Brieger, 48). The matter was accordingly referred to the Diet:
and after Aleander had, 13 Feb„ presented the Papal case fflrieger,
61 : b'alan, 59), it was resolved that Luther should be heard.
He reached &Vorms 16 April, and ‘ after dinner all the world came
to see him’ (Brieger, 143). Next day he was brought before
Emperor and Diet, and granted a day's delay to prepare [No. 42] his
final answer, 18 April, to the question, Would he recant? (‘ Acta '
in Lutlzeri Op. Lat. vi. 8 sqq.). On the '19th Charles announced
[No. 43] his future policy in regard to Luther (Armstrong,
Clearles V, i. 70 sq.), in terms which, in spite of the Gravamina
demanding a disciplinary reform which the Diet laid before him
early in May (Walch, Lnther’s Schriften, xv. 2058 sqq), naturally
issued in his [No. 44] alliance with the Pope, 8 May (Dumont,
(ξυνῇς Dz‘ploncatl'qae, IV. iii. 96 sqq), on the basis of joint
suppression of heresy, and in [No. 45] the Edict of Worms,
26 May (Goldasti Const. Imp. ii. 143 sqq.). Luther, who had left
VVorms 26 April, was spirited off out of harm’s way by ‘the Saxon
sox' (Brieger, 245), but according to dispatches of the Venetian
Ambassador (Cal. St. Papam, Venetiam, iii. 115 sqq.) and a letter
of the Archbishop of Mainz to Leo X (Balan, 268) [No. 46]
German feeling remained wholly on his side.

No. 39. Aleander’s Instructions.
