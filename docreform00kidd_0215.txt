1. i. 35, 142 sqq.): but they presently reported their powers
insufficient (ibid. 36). On 22 March 1528 fresh [No. 96] In—
structions to Visitors (ibid. 149 sqq.) appeared. (We print
below extracts from the Latin translation in Seckendorf, Cam-
mentam’us de Lutlzeram'smo, ΙΙ. xiii, ξ 36.) They were the work
of Melanchthon, with a preface by Luther; and were administered
by six different commissions in as many districts of the Electoral

¹ territory, 1528-9 (ibid. 41 sqq). The state of things which called

them forth is hinted in Luther's preface to [No. 97] The Short
Catechism (Wace and Buchheim, Lutlzer's Przmary Works, 1 sqq.)
of July 1529, which superseded his Greater Caleclzz'sm os the previous
spring (ibid. 24 sqq), and practically completed the new ecclesiastical
institutions of Saxony. To them ‘the whole of Lower 6611116111)γ
adhered ' with but ‘slight variations ⁵ (Ranke, Ray. 473).

ΙΙΙ. Other states and cities followed in the wake of Saxony. Thus
(a) Brandenburg-Anspach was conservative. Its rulers, since 1515,
were the two elder brothers of Albert Duke of Prussia, Margraves
Casirnir, †1527, a Catholic‚ and George, il543„ a Lutheran. At
the Diet of Anspach, 4 Oct. 1526, advantage was taken of the
Recess of Speier so far as to lay down that preachers should
confine themselves to the pure Word of God, but the Mass was
to continue and there was to be nothing preached against it ‘as if
in the holy Sacrament of the altar the body and blood of Christ
were not present’ (Richter, Kirclzenardnangen, i. 52). At a
second Diet, however, 1 March 1528, George established the new
order of things; and in 1533 there appeared the Church Order of

’ Brandenburg-Nijrnberg (ibid. i. 176) which had some influence
³* ’ on the English Prayer Book (Dowden, lee Worlcmanslzz'p os the

Prayer-B00k‚ pp. 30, 41) and became the parent of an important

¹ famil)y of Church Orders (Herzog, Realencyclopddie, x. 460, 3 ed.
⁴ 1901 .

(b) Hesse was at first revolutionary ; for the Synod of Homberg,

‘ 2ο Oct. 1526, proposed in the [No. 98] Reformatio ecclesiarum

Hassiae (Richter, Kz'rclzenordnungen‚ i. 56 sqq.) a scheme of Church
government which was elaborated by Francis Lambert, 1487‘*l·1530‚

⁴ a convert of Zwingli and a pupil of Luther. It was based upon

the independence of each Christian community‚ combined with the
strictest discipline. This was to apply Luther's own earlier ideals 3
but ‘he had already renounced them' (Ranke, Res. 461). He now
dissuaded the Landgrave, 7 Jan. 1527, from giving effect to the
proposals of the Synod as impracticable and premature (de Wette‚
vi. 80); and the Saxon ordinances took their place (Ranke, Res.
468; Richter, Kz'rclzenordmmgen, i. 163) from 1528.

(c) Brunswick-Luneburg, under Duke Ernest‚ became Lutheran
in 1527 (Richter, ibid. i. 70).

(α’) Of the Cities, Brunswick accepted the new order of things in
1528, and [No. 99] The Brunswick Church Order (ibid. i. 106 sqq),
sor which Bugenhagen drew upon the Saxon instructions of 16 June
1527, became the model osa second and generally conservative group
