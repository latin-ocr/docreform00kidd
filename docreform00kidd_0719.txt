them by the Cardinal of Bourbon, Archbishop of Rouen, in
Notre Darne Kirk of Paris 3 where the Bishop of Paris made
a very learned and eloquent sermon, in presence and assistance
of the King, Queen, and many prelates, noblemen‚ ladies, and
gentlemen‚ of all estates and calling, with most excellent
triumph, and the heralds crying with loud voices three sundry
times, ⁶ Largess ' 3 casting to the people great quantity of gold
and silver of all kind of sorts of coin, where there was great
tumult of people‚ every one troubling and pressing others for
greediness to get some part of the money. After which there
were as great magnifique solemnities used in the Kirk, with as
great dignity and reverence as was possible, which being done,
they entered into the bishop's palace, where there was a sum-
ptuous and princely dinner prepared for the whole company:
and after they had dined‚ there was used a princely dancing,
called the ball royal, to the great comfort and pleasure of all
being there present 3 and how soon the ball was ended, they
passed to the great hall of the palace royal, where they supped
with so great magnifioence, pomp, and triumph, that none of
the assistance there had ever seen the like 3 and there presently
was given to the Dauphin the title of King Dauphin, so that
he and the Queen were called thereafter King and Queen
Dauphin.

Maister calleth upon his owne, and that with vehemencie,
that they depart from Babylon; yea, severelie he threateneth
death and damnation to such as, either in forehead or in hand,
beare the mark of the Beast. And a portion of his marke are
all these dregges of Papistrie which were left in your great
Booke of England, any jote whereof will I never counsell any
man to use. One jote, Ι say, of these Diabolicall inventiouns,
viz. Crossing in Baptisme 3 Kneeling at the Lord's table 3 mum-
melling, or singing of the Letanie, cz fulgure et tempestate.-
a subitanea el improvisa morte, &o The whole Order os your
Booke appeareth rather to be devised for upholding of mas-
sing priests, then for any good instruction which the simple
people can thereos receive. Your Sacraments wer ministred,
be the most part, without the soule‚ and be those who to
Christ Jesus wer no true minister53 and God grant that so
yet they be not. Without the soule I say, they wer ministred,
