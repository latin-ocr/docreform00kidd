522 CALVIN, To His ARR1VAL

he was a graduate in LaW. They were the studies of a humanist :
pursued at the recently‚ March 1530, founded College de France‚
under the Regius Professors Pierre Danes‚ 1497—†1577‚ in Greek
(ibid. ii, No. 346, n. 10) and Francois Vatable, ?-†1547, in Hebrew:
and as a humanist he put out his first work, 4 April 1532, on
Seneca's De Clementia (Op. v. [= C. R. xxxiii] 1 sqq). But ‘late
in 1532 01· early 111 1533’ (Walker, 96) he experienced [No. 268]
a ‘ sudden conversion ’ (Op. xxxi. [= C. R. lix.] 21) as he describes
it. How far this took him towards his later doctrinal position waS,
perhaps, as doubtful to himself as to us. On 27 Oct. 1533 he still
writes (Herminjard, iii, No. 437) as member of a humanist circle
which included Gerard Roussel, 1480-1·1550, almoner of Francis Ι
and of‘ sa mignonne ’ his sister Margaret (b. 1492) Queen of Navarre,
1527—†49‚ and the new, 10 Oct. 1533, Rector of the University [No.
269] Nicholas Cop (ibid. iii, No. 438). 111 October the Rector had
incurred the anger of the Theologians by disavowing‚ on behalf of
the University‚ their censure of the Queen's Mz'roir de l’cime pe'clze-
resse: and, 1 Now„ in his inaugural address (Op. xb. [= C. lx'.
xxxviii] 30 sqq.) he borrowed not only from Erasmus but also from
Lutlier. Calvin was, at least, party to the address (cf. &Valken
100 sq.); and, in sear of, 10 Dec. [No. 270] the King's letter to
the Parlement of Paris (Herminjard, iii, No. 440) for the suppres-
sion of Lutheranism the two friends had to fiee. Calvin found refuge,
in the dominions of Margaret, with Louis du Tillet, parish priest of
Claix and Canon of Angouleme (ibid. iii, No. 457). On. 4 May
1534 he was at Noyon, to resign 1115 benefices in the ,Cathedral and
at Pont·l'Eveque (ibid. iii, No. 477, 11. 1); later in the year at
Orlc'ans, whence is dated [No. 271] the preface to the ‘Psycho-
pannychia' (Op. v. [= C. R. xxxiii] 170 sq.) his anti-Anabaptist
and first theological treatise.¹ Then 116 went to Paris, to keep an
appointment with Michael Servetus, 1509—†53‚ ‘mais le dit Servet
ne comparut quoy qu'on l‘attendist longtemps ' (Colladon‚ ap. Op.
xxi. [= C. R. xlix] 57). 11 was a ‘dangerous journey ' (ibim), 101
11 fell about the time of. 17-18 Oct., [No. 272] the Placards (Her-
minjard, iii, Nos. 485, 488 ; CerdesiuS, le'sl. [ᾗῇ iv, App. 59 sqq.)
os Antony Marcourt against the Mass. Thence to Strassburg; and
50, early in 1535. to Basel (Ami. Calv.. Op. xxi. [=C. R.x13x.] 194).

Religionis Institutio ² with a prefatory letter of23 Aug. (Op. i. [=
C. R. xxix.] 9 sqq.) to Francis Ι. Immediately after the publication of
the Institutes in March 1536, he paid a brief visit (Amz. Cultu, Op.
xxi. [= C. R. xlix] 199) to Rene'e‚ Duchess of Ferrara, 1510—†76;
and on his return 116 was, 111 August, [No. 274] detained by Farel
at Geneva (Op. xxxi. [= C. R. lix.] 23) and, 5 Sept„ [No. 275]
