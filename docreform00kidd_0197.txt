79 WITHIN THE EMPIRE, 1523-5 169

(10) Q. Whether they keep the hours of prayer, according
to the ordinances of the bishopric of Bamberg?

A. We do not pray according to the Bishop's ordinances
but according to the devotion of our heart.

(11) Q. Whether they forbid men to keep the fasts and
feasts of the saints according to ancient custom?

A. On Sunday we have the days announced but not en-
joined. We allow some feasts‚ and the eating of such things
as we have, with discrimination.

(12) Q. Whether they believe that, where a Couneil has
once been rightly assembled, in things pertaining to the Faith
and the interpretation of Holy Scriptum, men are under
obligation to obey it?

A. Where an entire Council decrees anything relating to
the Christian saith according to the tenor of the simple and pure
word of God, we hold that we are bound to be more obedient
to the ,word of God than to men. Where, however, they forbid
anything, contrary to holy Scriptum, one is under no obliga-
tion to obey.

(13) Q. Whether they were ordained priest according to
the order of the Church?

A. We were. The Prior said, Alas ἕ God have mercy on us l

(14) Q. Whether they admit themselves to be under the
Bishop's jurisdiction?

A. We have no lord but God only : but for His sake we sub-
mit ourselves to all creatures‚ particularly in that which befalls
us contrary to God's W ord or against our conscience.

(15) Q. Why they withdraw from the ancient custom of
the Church3 and, in answer to his Grace's admonition at
ordination, gave but a formal promise?

A. We confess that we have promised to obey your Grace
at our receiving of Orders, but we call the word of God to
witness that bids and commands us to do otherwise.

(16) Q. Why they did not, before changing and altering
such customs of the Church, ask his Grace's permission?

A. We did approach your Grace before making any change,
particularly in regard to Communion in Both Kinds, as
also the letters sent to your Grace notify. Your Grace
replied that we must make no change till the coming Council.
But as the Council is still unheld, and is probably put off for
a considerable time, we have changed the ancient customs of
the Church and ordered them after the Word of God, since we
are bound to obey God rather than man.
