sibi toto terrarum orbe subditum, monendo, increpando, etiam
sacerdotiis privando castiget. Id si semel Germani quum in
nostris tum in suis sacerdotibus factum videant, nulla posthac
de Luthero fiet mentio. Itaque in Nobis ipsis omnium malo-
rum origo pariter et medela sita est.

‘The Pope,’ said Chieregato [cf. W iilcker and Virck, op. cia,
Nr. 121 ξ 7] ‘was convinced of Frederick's good intentions :
[ξ 8] Luther had done good service in bringing abuses to light,
for many popes had done much that was ill-advised, and Leo X
was not free from his share of blame. But when Luther pro-
ceeded to attack the order of the Church‚ the sacraments‚ the
authority of Fathers and Council, he became absurd and in-
tolerable. [§ 9] Now that there was an upright and pious
Pope, every one ought to help him in his good endeavours
for the repose of the Church, the peace of Christendom, and
the expulsion of the Turk.’ He expressed ‘his hope that
Planitz was of the same opinion ⁷. Planitz [ξ 11] ‘was no
theologian, and did not profess to judge whether Luther⁷s
opinions were right or wrong. [ᾗ 12] As for the Elector, he,
as a layman, did not pretend to interfere with ecclesiastical
matters : [ξ 13] he did not banish Luther‚ because, if he were
gone, less responsible men would take his place, indeed,
Luther⁷s return to Wittenberg had prevented worse mischief,
and if he were driven elsewhere he would only speak more
strongly and spread his influence. [ξ 14] One thing was
clear, that force would be no remedy. Luther relied on his
learning and on the Scriptures‚ and could only be met on the
same grounds. Learned men must confer quietly with
Luther‚ and the results of their conference must be laid before

a General Council. [ξ 15] Chieregato listened sympathetically
and seemed to agree.7
