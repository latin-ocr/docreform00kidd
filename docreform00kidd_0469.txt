THE REFORMATION coMPLETED IN mincii,
1524—5

At the third and last Disputation‚ 19 Jan. 1524, the Council
was advised that Canon Hoffmann and his friends had not made
out their case from Holy Scripture (Egli, Aktensammlung, No.
483, ξ 6 ; BuHinger, Regformalz‘onsgesclzichle, i, ᾗ 84). They there-
fore gave, 19 Jan.‚ these [No. 201] men of the Old Learning
their choice between submission and banishment (Egli, No.
489): but they waited till Whitsuntide to carry reform further.
Ziirich, as yet, stood alone in the Confederation ; and had to meet
a remonstrance, 24 Jan., of the Diet of Luzern (Bullinger, i, ξ 85)
by, 21 March, a [No. 202] defence of its policy (ibid. ξ 93)
Finding it sase, at length, to go on, the Council, on Whitsun Eve,
14 May, abolished (Egli, No. 5273 Bullinger, i, ξ 97) the whit-
Monday procession to Einsiedeln. Next, in view of the Bishop’s
vindication, 25 May, οξ Images and the Mass (ibid. i, ξ94), they

(Zuz'nglz'i Opera, i. 604 sqq), mainly from Zwingli's pen. They
then spent June in [No. 203] casting out organs and relies (Egli,
No. 5473 Bullinger, i, § 98), and 2-17 July (Egli, No. 552) in
putting away images (Bullinger, i, ξ 103). On5 Dec. (Egli, No. 598)
they (No. 204) dissolved the Religious Houses (Bullinger, i, §Q
129, 130) ς and, at Zwingli’s suggestion (Opera, II. ii. 327) devoted
their revenues to education and to relies of the poor. By Christmas
1524 only the Mass remained. But in the De vera elsalsa
religione Commentarius, which he addressed to Francis I in March
1525, Zwingli delivered a final attack upon it (Opera, iii. 239) : and,
after representations, 11 April, from the three city pastors and
others, the Council, by a small majority, decreed, 12 April, its
abolition (Egli, No. 684). That day, Vl‘ednesday in Holy Week
[No. 205] Mass was said for the last time in Ziirich (shira).
On Maundy Thursday, Good Friday, and Eastcr Day (Bullinger, i,
ᾗ 147) its place was taken hythe [No. 206] Action oder Bruch
