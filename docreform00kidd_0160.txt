132 THE NEW ECCLESIASTICAL SYSTEM, 1523-4 66

Testamento‚ cum explanatione vernacula... more quem
Paulus 1 Cor. xiv describit.

Post, successu temporis peioris, cum deficerent prophetae et
interpretes, relicta est ista vox sola post lectiones et capitula
‘Deo gratias '‚ tum loco interpretationis multiplicatae sunt
lectiones, psalmi et hymni et alia in hanc taediosam prolixita-
tem, quanquam Hymni et ‘Te Deum laudamus' aeque id
testantur quod ‘Deo gratias '‚ scilicet quod post interpretationes
et homilias Deum laudarint‚ et gratias egerint, pro revelata
veritate sermonum Dei. Quales et ego vellem fieri nostras
vernaculas cantilenas. . . .

No. 67. The beginnings of German Hymnody.
Ez'n' fiste Burg ist unser Gott.

A safe stronghold our God is still,
A trusty shield and weapon; ⁴

He ’ll help us clear from all the ill
That hath us now o'ertaken.

The ancient Prince of Hell

Hath risen with purpose fell;
Strong mail of Craft and Power
He weareth in this hour,

On Earth is not his fellow.

With force of arms we nothing can,
Full soon were we down-ridden5
But for us fights the proper Man,
Whom God himself hath bidden.
Ask ye, Who is this same?

Christ Jesus is His name,

The Lord Zebaoth⁷s Son,

He and no other one

Shall conquer in the battle.

And were this world all Devils o'er,
And watching to devour us,

We lay it not to heart so sore,

Not they can overpower us.

And let the Prince of 111

Look grim as e'er he will,

He harms us not a whit;

For why? His doom is writ,

A word shall quickly slay him.
