698 THE OVERTHROW OF THE 345

was the kirk of Dundie reformed before my arrivall 3 publict
prayers were in other placeS‚ which thing did so stirre the adver-
saries, that the preachers were summouned by the authoritie to
answere, as criminall‚ before a civil! judge. The day of their
appearance was the 10th of May 1559, which was the 8th day
after my arrivall. Being moved in conscience to give confes-
sioune with mybrethrein, after the rest of one day in Edinburgh,
Ι prepared my self to repaire toward them 3 and so, upoun the

third day after, Ι came to Dundie, where a great assemblie of 3!
hrethrein κως, for consultatioun what was most expedient in ι

that doubtfull case. The conclusioun was, that the whole multi- 7'

tude and number of hrethrein sould accompanie their preachers,

and give confessioun of their saith with them3 and so from ³²

Dundie, they departed to Sanct Johnstoun [Perth], whilk late be-
fore had receaved the Order of Common Prayers. But least that
such a multitude might have engendered some suspicioun of re-
sistance and rebellioun against the authoritie, one of the most
grave and most wise barouns was directed to the Queene Regent
with declaration of our mindes 3 which being understand by

the Queene and her Counsell, it was required of us that the ᾗ
multitude sould stay, and not come to Stirline‚ which place ι,

was appointed to the preachers to compeir: and so sould no Γ
extremitie be used, hut the summounds sould'be continued ,

till farther advisement3 which being glaidlie granted of us,
some of the hrethrein returned to their dwelling-places. But
the Queene and her Counsell, nothing mindefull of her and
their promise, incontinent did call the preacherS, and for laike
of comperance, did exile and putt them and their assistants to
the horne3 which deceate being spied, the hrethrein soght the
nixt remedie.1 And first, after complaint and appellatioun
frome such a deceitfull sentence, they putt to their hands to
reforrnatioun in Sanct Johnstoun, where the places of idolatrie
of Gray and Blacke Friers, and of Charter-house monkes, were
made equall with the ground3 all monuments of idolatrie, that
could be apprehended, consumed with fire3 and preests com-
manded, under paine ofdeath, to desist frome their blasphemous
masse. . . .
