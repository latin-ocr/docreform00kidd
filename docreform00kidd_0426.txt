398 THE BEGINNINGS OF THE 175

Christus benignitate sua velut postliminio mundum nunc per
evangelium clarius illustrarit, si miseri mortales ad libertatem
respiciant. . . .

Haec sunt Erasme, frater carissime, quae hisce diebus
accepimus vel dedimus vulnera coram sacerdotum senatorum-
que ordine3 hae rursum medelae, quibus infirmis succurrimus.
Tumultuarie omnia, ut a nobis acta, ita scripta sunt.. ..
Summam tamen actionis omnino attigi, sive apud senatum
sive sacerdotum ordinem, sive privatim habitam. Vespera
enim illa qua mane cum sacerdotum ordine egerant, casu in
eos incidi et multa cum illis contuli. Ex quibus omnihus
didici, ubi loci ulcus eos urat.

No. 176. The decision of the Great Councss,
9 April 1522.
Burgomaster Schmid and the Council.

(1) Whereas at the beginning of this Lent sundry persons
ate flesh . . . and perhaps assumed that they were not thereby
sinning against God's commandments, though much and divers
debate and dissension arose thereon, in such sort that our
gracious Lord of constance, as our Ordinary and Bishop,
sent to Ziirich his worshipful Commission, to wit, the Bishop
Suffragan, the preacher of the Cathedral at Constance and his
Chancellor, who came first to the Provost and Chapter of
SS. Felix and Regula and afterwards to the Little and to the
Great Council‚ and with fatherly fidelity and charity admonished
us. . . . And whereas such admonition, with much more fine
speaking on the part of the Commission of our gracious Lord
of Constance took place before the Little and the Great
Councils in the presence of the three people's priests of the
Great Minster, of our Lady's Minster, and of St. Peter’s, and the
three people's priests were heard thereon through Master
Uolrich Zwingli.-N ow therefore it is resolved, and requested
of the Commission of our gracious Lord of Constance to
express our high and diligent thanks to him for his fatherly
notice and faithful admonition‚ and with special earnestness
to desire his Grace that without delay he would do his
utmost to get the matter brought before his Holihess the
Pope, by the cardinals, bishops, councils‚ or by true Christian
men of learning, so that at length an elucidation and answer
might be given how and in what way men should order
themselves in such case, so that nothing be done against the
laws of Christ.
