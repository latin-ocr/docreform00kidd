mercy where none was deserved, to promise and give life
where death had gotten the victory, to receive us into Thy

be used in remembrance of His death, until His coming again,

have received liberty and life, that by Him alone Thou dost
acknowledge us Thy children and heirs, that by Him alone we
have entrance to the throne of Thy grace that by Him alone
we are possessed in our spiritual Kingdom, to eat and drink at
His Table, with whom we haxe our conversation presently in
heaven, and by whom our bodies shall be raised up agam from
the dust, and shall be placed with Him in that endless joy,
which Thou, O F ather of mercy, hast prepared for Thine Elect

before the foundation of the world was laid. And these most , ³

inestimable benefits we acknowledge and confess to have >

received of Thy free mercy and grace, by Thine only beloved

Son Jesus Christ, for the which therefore, we Thy congrega· ζ

and glory, for ever and ever. Anien.
