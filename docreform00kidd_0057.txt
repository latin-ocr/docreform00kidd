ἵ No. 13. Luther’s segmen on Indulgence and
’ ’ ⁷ race.

First you ought to know that some modern teachers such as
the Master of the Sentences, S. Thomas [Aquinas] and their
followers‚ divide Penance into three parts, namely Contrition‚
Confession‚ and Satisfaction: and although this distinction,
according to their meaning, was found to be hardly or not at
all grounded upon Holy Scriptum, nor upon the early fathers
of the Church, yet we are willing to let it stand and to speak
after their fashion . . .

Sixth . . . it cannot be proved from any Scripture that divine
justice requires or desires any other punishment or satisfaction
from the sinner than his hearty and true repentance and con-
version, with a resolution henceforth to bear the cross of Christ
and practise the good works before-mentioned, also imposed
on him by no man...

Ninth‚ if the Church were at this day to decide and declare
that indulgence made more satisfaction than works, still it were
a thousand-sold better, that no Christian man should purehase
or desire the indulgence, but rather perform the works and
suffer the loss . . .

Fourteenth, indulgence is allowed for the sake of imperfect
and slothful Christians‚ who will not exercise themselves in-
dustriously in good works or are impatient. For indulgence
improves no man, but only tolerates and allows his imperfection.
So men should not speak against indulgence, but neither should
they persuade any one to take it . . .
