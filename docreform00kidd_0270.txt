No. 105. The Resolution of the Majority‚
7 April 1529.

(5) Whereas, moreover, the said article has since been by
many drawn and expounded, under an entire misapprehension‚
to the excusing of all sorts of new doctrines and sects; there-
sore, to cut off such occasion and to avert further falling
away . . . the Electors, Princes, and other Estates have resolved
that those who have hitherto held to the aforesaid Imperial
Edict [sc. of Worms] should continue to abide by the same till
the coming Council, and hold their subjects theretO.

(6) T hat by the other Estates‚ with whom the other doctrine
originated and with whom, to some degree, it cannot be
abandoned without considerable tumult, trouble, and danger,
all further innovation shall nevertheless be prevented till the
coming Council, so far as is humanly possible.

(7) That‚ in particular, such doctrines and sects as deny the
most worthy sacrament of our Lord Jesus Christ's Body and
Blood shall in no wise be tolerated by the holy Empire of the
German Nation, nor be henceforth suffered . . . to preach in
public: nor shall the celebration of the holy Mass be done
away: nor shall any one, in places where the new doctrine has

got the upper hand, be forbidden to celebrate or to hear Mass,
nor be hindered or forced therefrom.

(9) Further, your Imperial Majesty bids and commands
every Estate‚ spiritual and temporal‚ by the duty which every
one owes to your Imperial Majesty, and on pain of losing every
one his sovereignties, feoffs, liberties‚ grants‚ and graces, that,
until the assembly and holding of the aforesaid Council, no
one, whether of spiritual or temporal Estate, shall, by actor
deed, in any wise use force against another to deprive and
despoil him of authority, goodS, rents, dues, and customs : and
whosoever, contrary to this your Imperial Majesty’s command-
ment, shall undertake or endeavour anything by force or deed,
the same shall by so doing be liable to your Imperial Majesty’s
displeasure‚ ban and re-ban, in accordancc with the foregoing
declaration. . . .
