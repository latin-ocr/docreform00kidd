67 THE NEW ECCLESIASTICAL SYSTEM, 1523—4 133

God's Word‚ for all their craft and force,
One moment will not linger

But spite of Hell, shall have its course,
’Tis written by His finger.

And though they take our life,

Goods, honour, children, wife,

Yet is their profit small3

These things shall vanish all,

The City of God remaineth.

THE MISSION OF CAMPEGGIO, 1523—4

On 18 Nov. 1523 Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, cousin of Leo X
was elected as Pope Clement VII, 1523—†34. ‘He knew the
importance of the German revolt’ (Creighton‚ Hz‘st. Papacy, vi. 281) :
and ‘Cardinal Campeggio', 1474—†1539, ‘was appointed legate
in Germany for the Lutheran affairs ’ (slafe Papers, Venelian, iii,
No. 795 ; 9 Jan. 1524). ‘A capable official but not a man of much
character’ (Creighton‚ vi. 282: cf. State Papers, Venetiam, iii,
No. 795), he [No. 68] entered Niirnberg, 16 March, according

ο to the united testimony of a friar in his train (State Papcrs,

Venetiam iii, No. 813) and of Spalatin (Mencken, Rerum Ger-
manz'carmn Scriptores, ii. 633 sq), without the usual pomp of
a Legate and only to find public feeling against him. At the
Diet ‘Campeggio demanded prompt execution of the Edict of
Worms. The Catholics were in a majority: but even among
the Estates, who were not a representative body but an assembly
of sovereigns, largely ecclesiastic, national feeling ran so strong
that the utmost he could secure’ (1<idd,Cont. Res. 35) was
[No. 69] the Recess of 18 April proposing to enforce the Edict ⁶ as
far as possible' and to summon a National Assembly at Speier
(Balan, Mon. Res< Luth. 330 sqq.: ef. Pallavicini, Ht'ss. Cam.
Trici. II. x. 15—18). This was a compromise, which pleased
nobody. [No. 70] Campeggio remonstrated with the Diet, but
to no effect (Balan, op. css. 332 sqq. ; pallavicini, 11. x. 19-23). The
[No. 71] Court ofRome had its own remedies(Pallavicini, ΙΙ. x.
23-27)‚ which were embodied in instructions to the Nuncios for the
consideration of the Emperor (Balari, op. cil. 339 sqq). On 18 July
[No. 72] Charles wrote to his ambassador at Rome bidding him
tell the Pope that (cf. his Edict of 15 July‚ in Luthers Schmsfen,
ed. Walch xv, 2705 sqq.) he had forbidden the ‘conventicle’ at
Speier‚ but advising a General Council at Trent (State Papcrs,
Spanile ii, No. 662 3 18 July 1524). But, meanwhile, Campeggio,
who had been authorized, 14 April, to treat with such princes as were
well disposed sor a ‘correctionem morum et reformationem cleri
Germaniae ‘ (Balari, Monmnenm rb'aec. XVI. 17), had succeeded in
applying the old policy of ‘Divide et impera' to the national
opposition of Germany. For on 7 July, by [No. 73] the League of
