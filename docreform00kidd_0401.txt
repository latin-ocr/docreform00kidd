of the three Leagues. The capital town of their country is
called Coire: they have societie and confederation with the
Swissers, and with them they go to the warre: they have
almost the same policie‚ the same lawes, the same manners,
and for warlike matters are preferred afore the Valesians‚‚but
they hold no comparison with the Swissers, either in numbers
or in valour. . . .

No, 156. Heinrich Goldli’s defence before the
Diet‚ 13 March 1520.

In regard to the second article, it is true, Ι have in time past
taken up livings and have requested them of the Pope. Ι serve
