‘disputings and propositions’ and ‘to fall in with my Lords’
opinions ⁹, because hereafter no further disputation is to take
place. If, however, they wish for any exception in the matter
of belief, they may apply to the Burgomaster or to the three
Overseers.

(2) Moreover, in order that there may be the more peace
from such folk, it is further resolved that the following shall
abjure my Lords' dominions, viz. the priest (William Roubli)
of Wyffikon, the assistant-curate (Brotli) of ZoHikon, Ludwig
Hetzer‚ and Andrew [Castelberger] uf der Stiilzen 3 and leave
the country within a week.

No. 212. Anabaptism begins, 7 Feb. 1525.

(i) From [Ι ] the Cmqfessz‘mz ofsom‘teen z'mprisoned anabaptisls
of Zollikon.— . . . They admitted that they had been baptized,
and had become ‘servants‚ bondmen, and subJects of God' 3 they
would do whatever the Spirit of God prompted them, and not
suffer themselves to be forced therefrom by any tempora]
magistrate. So far as they were not hindered by the Word of
God, they would be my Lords' subjects. [ΙΙ] . . . §2. Rudolph
Thomunn, of ZoHikon, deposed that he had eaten the Last
Supper with the old assistant-curate [Brotli ?] and· the [parson]
of Wytikon [William Roubli], and had invited thern to his
house. . . . There many had assembled, so that the room was
full 3 there was much speaking and long readings. Then
stood up Hans Bruggbach of Zumikon, weeping and crying out
that he was a great sinner, and asking them to pray God for
him. Whereupon Blaurock ¹ asked him if he desired the grace
of God. ‘Yes,' said he. Manz then stood up and said,
‘ Who will hinder me from baptizing him?' Blaurock
answered, ‘ Nobody.⁷ So [Manz] took a bowl² of water and
baptized him in the name of God the Father, God the Son, and
God the Holy Ghost. Whereupon James Hottinger stood up
and desired baptism3 and Felix Manz baptized him also. . . .
Seeing the loaf on the table, Blaurock said, ‘Whosoever
believes that God has redeemed him by His death and rosy-
coloured blood . . . comes and eats with me from this loaf and
drinks with me of this wine.' Then several ate and drank
thereos.
