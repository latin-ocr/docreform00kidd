290 THE DiE'r OF AUGSBURG‚ 1530 117

In the second place, there being in this city about twenty
most excellent doctors and theologians of holy, good, and
exemplary life, Your Highness can have them summoned or,
if it be your pleasure, Ι will undertake the task of calling them
and giving them the articles proposed which we would have
them with all care read ancl study3 and, after they have
exercised all prudence, moderatiori, and Christian charity, let
them, as soon as they can, proceed in the manner set forth
below—that is to say, let them first extract the heads and
assertions contained in the said articles or propositions, and not
only those which are expressed and are openlycalled propositions
but also those which are surreptitiously comprised therein.

Then, all such as are Catholic and well founded on the
Gospel‚ sacred Scriptum, and doctrine of the holy doctors, and
are approved by the holy Church‚ if such there be—let them
be pleased to accept, praise, and approve : but such as shall be
found to be heretical‚ false, seditious, disorderly‚ erroneous,
scaudalous, and ofsensive to pious Catholic ears, let them
demolish‚ destroy‚ and totally annihilare, after having first
shown them whence they have derived their asserfions, and
how in former times they were put forth by other heretics,
diligently examined by the holy Councils‚ and finally justly
condemned and burnt together with the same heretics, in
order that every one should understand and know that there
was to be no more disputing or gainsaying or reviving of doubt
about that which so justly, with excellent reasons and true
understanding of the holy Scriptum, had been reprobated and
condemned. Which thing can only be done with the greatest
danger, as Saint Maximus, the bishop, says in one of his
sermons :—‘ Noverimus itaque quia non sine magno discrimine
de religionis veritate disputamus, quam tantorum sanguine
confirmatam videmus. Magni periculi res est si post pro-
phetarum oracula, post apostolorum testimonia, post martyrum
vulnera, veterem fidem quasi novellam discutere praesumas, et
post tam manifestos duces in errore permaneas, et post morien—

tium sudores otiosa disputatione contendas.'¹ The Imperial Ἴ ‚³

Law also declares the same thing z—‘Nemo: c. de summa
Trim'tate et fide Catholz'cc13 Nemo clericus vel militans vel
alterius cuiuslibet conditionis de fide Christiana publice turbis
coadunatis et audientibus tractare conetur in posterum, ex hoc
turnultus et perfidiae occasionem requirens. Nam et iniuriam
facit iudicio reverendissimae Synodi‚ si quis semel iudicata ac
recte disposita revolvere ac publice disputare contendit, cum
