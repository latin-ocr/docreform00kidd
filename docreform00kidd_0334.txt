305 THE EXTENSION OF

progress 11 ent on as before. The theological approximation of
south to north was aided by [No. 127] the Concord of Witten-
berg, 29 May 1536 (empus Reform( lterum, iii. 75 s q.;q) but it was
endangered again (i’bzd. iii. 371) by [No. 128] the chlimalkaldic
Articles‚ 23 Feb. 1537 (Francke, Libri Symbolici Ecclesiae Luthe-
ranae, ii. 1 sqq). Still, the League,with these for its basis, found itself
strong enough to repudiate, 5 March (Le Plat, op. cit. ii. 575 sqq),
the Council convoked to meet in Mantua 23 May 1537: and,
before the Emperor was free again, Protestantisni was acknow-
ledged, 1539, in Albertine Saxony3 in Electoral Brandenburg; in
Mecklenburg-Schwerin, which was reformed by Duke Magnus,
Bishop of Schwerin‚ 1516—†50 3 and in Brunswick-Calenberg,
1540, through the Duchess Elizabeth of Brandenburg, regent for
her son Eric ΙΙ, 1540- †84.

In Albertine Saxony (cf. L. Pastor, Dte lerchlz'clcen Reum'ons-
b suebungen, 146 sqq.) Duke George’s ideal of a reformation
was advocated by his chancellor Carlowitz at [No. 129] The
Colloquy of Leipzig, 2 Jan 1539, with the Elector' s adviser Bruck
(ap. Seckendorf, 111. xix, ξ 71, 208), but it was too Erasmian for
the representatives of the Elector and the Landgrave—-mere

‘Wiseacres‘ botching’ (Pastor, op. cia 157). The old duke died
16 April 15393 and, at Luther’ s advice, his brother and successor,
Duke Henry, 1539-r41, instituted a visitation to introduce the
Reformation (Seckendorf, 217). His bishops‚ Johann von Maltitz‚
of Meissen, 1534— †49, and Sigismund von Lindenau, 5135-†44‚ of
Merseburg, stood aloof, the former protesting ‘quod absque suo
consensu visitationem Dux instituerit quae pertineat ad officium
episcopi ’, but to no purpose. The Visitation was hurriedly carried
out by agents frorn Wittenberg, by Instructions of 10 July 1539
(Sehling, Die evangelisalzen Kz'rclzenordnuszgen, I. i. 257 sqq.) and
a Church Ordinance (ibid. 264 sqq. ). Under Henry’s son and
successor, Maurice, 1541-153, consistory and superintendents took
the place of bishops (ιύίώ Ι. i. 95).

111 Electoral Brandenburg (cf. Seckendorf,111.xx,§75,234 s.qq,
Heidemann‚ Dte Reformatzon m der M arl‘Brandenburg Joachim, Ι
1499- —†1 5 3 5 was a strenuous opponent of Luther, not least because,
under Luther's influence (de Wette‚ iii. 296), his wife Elizabeth had
at Easter, 1527, declared herself Lutheran by receiving the Sacra-
ment in both kinds. She then (Spalatin, ap. Mencken, Scriptores
rerum Germanicarum, ii. 1116) took refuge, 24 March 1528, with
her uncle, John Elector of Saxony. Joachim died 11 July 1535;
and was succeeded (a) in the Neurnark by his younger son, Hans
1011 Kiistrin 1513- †71, who, with his people, nent over, Easter
1538, by receiving communion in both kinds. and (b) m the Kur-
mark by Joachim ΙΙ, 1535- †71. This prince, brought up by his
uncle Albert, Cardinal Archbishop of Mainz, was married to
Magdalen, daughter of Georg e, Duke of Saxony. He was held
back, first, by that connexion; then, after her death, by his second
marriage, 1535, to Hedwig, daughter of the Catholicy Sigismund,
