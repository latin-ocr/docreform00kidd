366 SWITZERLAND IN 1513 150

No. 150. The Diet of Eadem, 11 Aug. 1512.

(a) At this Diet appeared the Bailiff of Lorraine‚ and in the
name of the Duke informed them as follows :--1t was rumoured
that certain of the Confederates were marching through his
territory upon the King of F rance, and that the Duke had given
thern his permission to pass through. The latter statement was
incorrect3 the passage had taken place without his knowledge
and consent 3 and no sooner had he received information of it
than he had issued strict orders forbidding such passage 3 and
in the case of some of his own subjects‚ who notwithstanding
were bent upon marching towards F rance, had had them
arrested and was about to punish them. He entreated the
Consederation to have him excused, and to believe that he
was in no way desirous of setting himself against them. Further,
it was rumoured that his brother was with the King of F rance.
That was true. At the apportionment of the Duchy, that portion
had fallen to his brother which was under vassalage to the King
of France. He could not therefore avoid his obligations of
sealty 3 and this the Duke begged the Confederation to bear in
mind.

(b) The Pope bestowed upon the Honourable Consedera-
tion, in consideration of their good and true services, compli-
mentary gifts of sword, hat, and two banners. Next day, it
was to be decided where these presents were to be kept for
the benefit of the Confederation as a whole.

(c) To-day appeared an embassy from the King of Spain
with a request that the Confederation would make alliance with
the Pope, the King of Spain, and the Doge of Venice,1 and
conclude the same either in perpetuity or, failing this, for three
years, or for so long as the alliance between the three should
continue. Would the Consederation also use its influence to
make up the quarrel between the Emperor and Venice, so that
then all five states might enter into a common unity and
alliance? It would be well to take this matter in hand at once,
for the King of Spain was keeping his troops in the field at
such heavy outlay as would soon become intolerable.

(d) Then there appeared, as ambassador from the Duke of
Savoy, the Dean of Colmar, who requested that the setting
up of a league between the Consederation and the Duke might
be hastened. He defended the Duke against the charge, that
he was against us as a dependant of the King of France and
