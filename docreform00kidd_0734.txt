notes, signes, and assured takens whereby the immaculate Spouse
of Christ Jesus is knawen fra the horrible harlot, the Kirk
malignant, we affirme, are nouther antiquitie, title usurpit, lineal
descence, place appointed, nor multitude of men approving ane

Jerusalem had prerogative above all places of the eird, where
alswa were the Priests lineally descended fra Aaron 3 and greater
number followed the Scribes‚ Pharisies, and Priestes, then un-
fainedly beleeved and approved Christ Jesus and his doctrine:
and 3it, as we suppose, no man of sound judgment will grant,
that ony of the forenamed were the Kirk of God. The notes
therefore of the trew Kirk of God we beleeve, confesse, and avow

to be, first, the trew preaching of the worde of God, into the ·

quhilk God hes revealed himselfe unto us, as the writings of
the Prophets and Apostles dois deelair. Secundly‚ the right

In the quhilk we affirme, that all thingis necessary to be beleeved ’

for the salvation of mankinde, is sufficiently expressed. The

private nor publick persone, nether 3it to ony Kirk, for ony :e
preheminence or prerogative, personallie or locallie, quhilk ane ξ
