6 ‹⁷†OMMISSI()N OF INDULGENCES ¹3
three directed to Germany and neighbouring lands: 2 Dec. 1514
to Giovanni Angelo de' Arcemboldi for the provinces of Koln,
Trier‚ Salzburg, Bremen, Besancon, Upsala, &c. (Hergeniother,
Leom‘sX Regesta, n. 13053); 10 Jan. 1515 to Cristofero de Forli
for Poland,¹ &c. (ibid. n. 13641); and 31 March 1515 to Albert of
MainZ, 1514—†45‚ for his provinces of Mainz and Magdeburg (ibid.
n. 14825). He had obtained his electiori to the archbishopric of
Main2‚ 1514, by promising to pay for the pallium himself. It eost
20‚000 gulden, and this sum had already been levied twice within
the preceding decade on the territories of the see. To keep his
promise he borrowed money from the banking house of Fugger at
Augsburg‚ who arranged with the Pope to reimburse themselves out
ofthe Indulgence by retaining half the proceeds and to pay over the
remainder to the Holy See. The bargain was concluded in 1515,
but its execution was deferred till 1517. The Elector then put
the business of preaching the indulgence into the hands of the
Dominican John Tetzel, 1470—†1519‚ as his sub—commissary. Tetzel
had had long experience of such work, ever since 1502 ; and, being
at once an able theologiam and a stirring preacher‚ he had been
uniformly successful at it. Albert issued an [N 0. 6] Instructio Sum-
maria (Gerdesii Introducsia in Historiam Evangelii saeculo xvi
renovati, Monumenta‚ No. ix, ed. Groningae, 1744) for his sub-com-
missaries. Tetzel issued a similar [No. 7] Instructio (Loescher,
Rey‘brmalionsacta, i. 41 5) sor the parochial clergy, and also provided
them with [No. 8] specimen sermons (ibid. i. 416 sqq.) which
illustrate his style of preaching. [No. 9] Descriptions of the
proceedings (F. Myconius, 1491—†1546, Historia Rcformaliom‘s
ap. Gieseler‚ Ecclesiastical Histmy, v. 362, ed. 185 5) have also come
down to us from contemporary hands, and [No. 10] specimen
grants (Loescher, op. cit. i. 394).

² Ranke says that the commission of Cristosero ‘included only Switzer-
land ‘and Austria’ (Histmy of the quormation, 151 : ed. R. Α. Johnson,
1905). The Regesla say ‘ Poloniae &c.'. ln Switzerland Cristofero's
deputy was Bernhardin Samson (see No. 164, iufra).
