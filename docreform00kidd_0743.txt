 

351 AND WORSHIP IN SCOTLAND, 1560—4 715

grant unto us, miserable sinners, so excellent a gift and treasure‚
as to receive us into the fellowship and company of Thy dear Son
Jesus Christ our Lord, whom Thou deliveredst to death for us,
and hast given Him unto us as a necessary food and nourish-
ment unto everlasting life. And now we beseech [Thee] also,
O heavenly Father, to grant us this request‚ that Thou never
suffer us to become so unkind as to forget so worthy benefits,
but rather imprint and fasten them sure in our hearts, that we
may grow and increase daily more and more in true saith,
which continually is exercised in all manner of good works,
and so much the rather, O Lord, confirm us in these perilous
days and rages of Satan, that we may constantly stand and
continue in the confession of the same, to the advancement
of Thy glory, who art God over ι11 things, blessed for ever.
So be it.

XVHY THIS ORDER IS OBSERVED RATHER THAN ANY OTHER.

IF so be that any would marvel why we follow rather this
Order than any other, in the administration of this Sacrament‚
let him diligently consider that first of all we utterly renounce
the error of the Papist53 secondly, we restore unto the Sacra-
ment his [its] own substance, and to Christ His proper place.
And as for the words of the Lord’s Supper, we rehearse them,
not because they should change the substance of the bread or
wine, or that the repetition thereos, with the intent of the
sacrificer‚ should make the Sacrament, as the Papists falsely
believe, but they are read and pronounced to teach us how to
behave ourselves in that action, and that Christ might witness
unto our faith, as it were with His own mouth, that He hath
ordained these signs to our spiritual use and comfort 3 we do,
first, therefore, examine ourselves, according to St. Paul’s rule,
and prepare our mindS, that we may be worthy partakers of so
high mysteries ,· then, taking bread, we give thanks, break and
distribute it as Christ our Saviour hath taught 1153 finally, thc
administration ended, we give thanks again according to His
example, so that without His word and warrant there is nothing
in this holy action attempted.
