 

THE ANABAPTISTS IN Z'URICH. 1525—32 451

(Zuinglz'i Opera, i. 539: supra, No. 197). They were led by
Conrad Grebel, †1526‚ and Felix Mam, †1527‚ both ZiiricherS, and
by Balthasar Hubmaier‚ 1480—†1528‚ pastor of Waldshut. Their
aim was to apply consistently the principle which governed the
official reforms, and admit nothing without explicit wari-ant of
Scripture. The baptism of infants has no such warrant 3 as,
on 1 May 1523 [No. 209] Zwingli admitted to Hiibmaier (Fiiss-
lin, Beytrlzge, i. 252 sq.; cf. Zuz'nglz'z' Opera, i. 260). By 5 Sept.
1524, when Grebel and his friends were in correspondence with
the revolutionary but never Anabaptist Thomas Miinzer‚ 1490—
†1525‚ now near Waldshut‚ they were ‘not twenty’ in number
(Cornelius, Gesckiclzte des Affz'inslerisclzen Azffrulzrs, ii. 248). But
they stood to [No. 210] their opinions (ibid. 245; and Zuz'nglz'z'
Opera, II. i. 338 sq.) so boldly that, after, 17 Jan. 1525, an abortive
disputation (Bullinger‚ i, ξ 135), 011 18 Jan. [No. 211] the Council
ordered infant baptism and silenced their leaders (Egh, Nos.
622, 624). Then began [No. 212] Anabaptism by sprinkling or
by pouring before 7 Feb., at Zollikon ¹ (ibid. No. 636, ἕξ 1, 2) ε after-
wards, by immersion (Kessler, Sabbata, i. 262) near Schaffhausen :
then, Easter 1525, at Waldshut (Egli, No. 911, ξ 4). On 20 March
there was a second disputation (ibid. No. 668) ; and ‘fourteen men
and seven women ' were thrown into the XVitches' Tower . . . to see
if it were possible to turn them from their error' (Bullinger, i,
§ 145). But, 5 April, they escaped (Egli, No. 691). At last, after,
6 Now, a third disputation (ibid. No. 853; Bullinger‚ i, ξ 163) had
proved ineffectual‚ on 7 March 1526 [No. 213] the Council
decreed, as if to suit the penalty to the crime, that Anabaptists
should be drowned (Egli, No. 9363 Zuz'nglii Opera, vii. 477).
Manz was the first so to suffer, 5 Jan. 1527 (Egli, No. 1109); two
countrymen‚ 23 March 1532, the last (z‘bsd. No. 1829). Meanwhile,
a literary warfare broke out. In the treatise of 27 May 1525
On baptism, anabaptzs-m, and iry‘anl baptism (Opem, ΙΙ. i. 230 599),
there occurs [No. 214] Zwingli’s statement of his position ( Opera,
tr. R. Gualther, ii. 97 b). H'ubmaier replied, 11 July, with lee
Chrislian baptism (gf Belz'evers (see a summary of its argument in
Vedder, Ball. Hilbmczz'en 114 sq.). And the controversy closed
with, 31 July 1531, the li'efittatson of the tricks of tlte Catabaptists
(Opera, iii. 357 sqq„ tr. Jackson, Selectz’onssrom ZaAngH, 123 599),
where [No. 215] Zwingli gives his account of the movement
(Opera, iii. 363 sq.).

No. 209. Hiibmaier’s evidence, 1525, upon
Zwingli’s admissions, 1 May 1523.

In 1523, on Philip and James’ day, Ι conferred with you
[Zwingli] in Graben street upon the Scriptures relating to
Baptism. Then and there you said I was right in saying that
children should not be baptized before they were instructed in
