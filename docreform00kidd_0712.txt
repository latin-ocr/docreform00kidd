684 THE DUTCH REFORMED, 1559-62 331

Emperor never yielded to threats or to sear, but the king
under very small apprehensions has given away states.

The Emperor governed entirely according to his own views,
but the king governs according to the views of others, and he
has no esteem for any nation except the Spanish 3 he consorts
only with Spaniards, and with these only ᾖε takes counsel and
governs. Moreover, contrary to the custom of the Emperor,
he takes no notice of Italians and Flemings, and least of all
Germans, and although he retains the chief men of each nation
in his kingdom, still it is observed that he declines to admit
any one of them to his secret councils, but keeps them only

sor affairs of war3 and he probably acts thus, not so much t

because he has a good opinion of them, as to prevent their
services being employed by his enemies. For this reason he
has never summoned either the Duke of Savoy or the Duke

Ottavio to the Council of State, but only to the Council of ¹3

War, into which all the chief officers, and even the colonels,
are admitted. The Duke Ottavio has nicknamed this Council
the ‘Council of the Populace ⁷.

According to my opinion thc kingdom of England will always
be in alliance with his Majesty‚ from sear of being harassed by
lsrance, which already possesses Calais and Boulogne this side
of England, and the kingdom of Scotland on the other.¹

from the retinue of the Duke of Savoy, and also from the nephew
of the French Ambassador‚ that an attack may be made on
Geneva the moment the Duke ² is reinstated, both to recover
that city, which he alleges belongs to him, as also to deprive
the heretics of Italy and France of that convenient seat of
refuge. . . .

King Philip’s request, had consented to free these Provinces
