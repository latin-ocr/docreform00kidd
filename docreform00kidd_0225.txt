95 LUTHERAN COMMUNITIES, 1526—9 197

and call and incite others to faith, until those Christians who
are most thoroughly in earnest shall discover each other and
cleave together3 to the end that there be no faction-forming‚
such as might ensue if I were to settle everything out of my
own head. For we Germans are a wild, rude, tempestuous
people 3 with whom one must not lightly make experiment in
anything new, unless there be most urgent need.

Well, then: in the name of God. The first requisite in the
German system of Divine Worship is a good, plain, simple, and
substantial Catechism. A Catechism is a form of instruction
by which heathen, desirous of becoming Christians‚ are taught
and shown what they are to believe, to do, to leave undone
and to know in Christianity. Hence mere learners who were
admitted to such instruction, and were acquiring the rudiments
of the Christian saith before their baptism were called cate-
chumens. This instruction or inforination I know no better
way of putting than that in which it has been put from the
beginning of Christianity till to—day: I mean, in those three
articles of the Ten Cornniandments, the Creed, and the Lord’s
Prayer. In those three articles is contained, plainly and

is to preach and teach the Word of God, let us begin with the

for the sake of servants that they also rnay be provided for and
may hear the Word of God, if they are not able to be present
at other sermons. After that, an antiphon with Te Deum or
Benedictus alternately, with Our Fatlzer, Collect, and Bene-
dicamus Domino. At Mass, about 8 a.1n. or 9 a.m., there
should be a sermon on the Gospel, as found according to the
season. In the afternoon, at V espers, before stlagmficat,
sermons in regular course. The reason why we have retained
the division of the Epistles and Gospels into portions corres-
ponding with the season of the [Church's] year is that wc have
nothing particular to find fault with in such arrangement. It
has been the case at Wittenberg up till now that there are
