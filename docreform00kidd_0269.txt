104 THE DIET OF SPEIER, 1529 241

Majesty and his Holiness the Pope are, by the grace of
Almighty God, in such good Christian accord that, as your
Majesty is assured, there is no refusal on the part of his
Holiness to hold the General Council . . . it is your Majesty's
gracious offer to urge his Holiness to allow the summoning of
such a Council. . . .

(4) Meanwhile, it is your Majesty‘s will, intention, and
strict command to every limate, spiritual and temporal, of
higher or lower degree, by the duty which every one owes to
your Imperial Majesty and the Holy Empire, at peril of losing
his sovereignties‚ rights, freedoms, grants, and graces, and also
of incurring such strict pains and penalties as are comprised in
the published edicts, that, until the assembly and holding of
the aforesaid Council, no one, whether of spiritual or of temporal
estate, shall, to the detriment of our true Christian saith, use
violence or force against ancient usages and customs‚ or go over
to any wrong or strange creed, or attach himself to any new
sect, as may hitherto have happened in some places.

(7) And whereas in the Recess of the Diet of Speier, made
in the . . . year 1526, an article was comprised saying that ‘the
Electors, Princes, and Estates of the Empire, and the ambassa-
dors of the same unanimously agreed and resolved‚ while
waiting for the Council, with our subjects‚ in matters which
the edict published by his Imperial Majesty at the Diet holden
at Worms may concern, each one so to live, govern, and carry
himself as he hopes and trusts to answer it to God and his
Imperial Majesty‚ &c.'; and whereas, from the same article,

- as hitherto understood, expounded, and explained at their

pleasure by several of the Estates of the Holy Empire,
marvellous great trouble and misunderstanding has arisen
against our holy Christian saith, as also against the Magistrates
through the disobedience of their subjects, and much other
disadvantage, your Imperial Majesty conceives no small as-
tonishment, thereat: and to the end that, for the future, the
said article may be no further taken and expounded
at every man's pleasure, and that the consequences, which
hitherto have proved so disastrous to our holy saith, may be
averted, your Imperial Majesty hereby repeals, revokes, and
annuls the above-mentioned article contained in the aforesaid
Recess, now as then, and then as now, all out of your own
Imperial absolute power. . . .
