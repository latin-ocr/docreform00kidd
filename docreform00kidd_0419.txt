No. 172. Street-fighting.

Michael Ferrich, a journeyman shoemaker from Wiirzburg‚
came to blows with James Schmidt of Meilen about the month
and eating flesh. The one said, ‘People eat flesh in March.²
‘No, that they don’t,' replied the other. ‘Well,' continued
the stranger‚ ‘it seems to me there are folks in this country
who can get on better with whey and cheese than with Scrip-
ture.' And when he went on to chaff his fellow about his ‘old
cow-country⁷ and so forth, they fell to settle it with their fists,
till the neighbours made peace.

you, my Lords, charge yourselves with the affair and put me
