95 LUTHERAN COMMUNITIES, 1526—() 199

out of the Old Testament‚ a chapter or half a chapter according
to its length. Then let one boy read it in German. Next‚
Magm'ficat in Latin, with an antiphon or chant. Then Our
Fatlzer silently and the Collects with the Benedimmzls. So

much for Divine Ser-vice daily throughout the week in towns
where there are schools.

(iii) On Sundays for the laity.

The Mass vestlnents‚ altam, and lights may be retained till
such time as they shall all change of themselves, or it shall
please us to change them : though, if any will take a different
'course in this matter, we shall not interfere, But in the true
Mass, among sincere Christians, the altar should not be re-
tained, and the priest should always turn himself towards the
people as, without doubt, Christ did at the Last Supper.
That, however, must bide its time.

[a] At the beginning then¹ we sing a, spiritual song or a
psalm in German, [72 pm'mo lone, as follows : Ps. xxxiv.

[b] Then Kjvrse eleison, to the same tone, but thrice and not
nme times. . . .

[c] Then the priest reads a Collect in Effaut in am'sono, as
follows ς ‘Almighty God‚' &e

[d] Then the Epistle, in the eighth tone.. . .The Epistle
should be sung with the face turned to the people, but the
Collect with the face turned to the altar.

[e] After the Epistle is sung a German hymn, ‘Nun bitten
wir den heiligen Geist‚’ or some other, by the whole choir.

[f] Then is read the Gospel in the fifth tone, also with the
face turned towards the people.

[g] After the Gospel the whole¹ congregation sings the
Creed in German, ‘ Wir glauben all⁷ an einen Gott,' &c

[lc] Then follows the sermon, on the Gospel of the Sunday
or Holyday: and I think that, where the German Postills are
in use throughout the year, it were best to order the Postill of
the day, either whole or part, to be read out of the book to
the people 3 not merely for the preacher's sake who can do no
better, hut as a safeguard against fanatics and sectaries‚--a
eustom of which one may see traces in the Homilies at
Mattins. Otherwise, where there is no spiritual understanding,
