348 ANCIENT CHURCH IN SCOTLAND, 1560 701

Bischoppis heir present speakis nothing in the contrait os
the doctrine proponed‚ 1 can nott but hold it to be the verie
trewth of God, and the contrarie to be deceavable doctrine.
And thairfoir, so far as in me lyeth, I approve the one and
dampne the other: And do farther ask of God, that not onlie
1, but also all my posteritie‚ may enjoy the comforte of the
doctrin that this day our earis have hearde. And yitt more,
I man vote, as it war by way of protestatioun‚ that yf any
persones ecclesiasticall shall after this oppone thame selfis to
this our Confessioun, that thei have no place nor credite,
considdering that thei having long advisement, and full knaw
ledge of this oure Consessioun, none is now found in lauchfull‚
free, and quyete Parliament to oppone tharne selfis to that
whiche we professe: And thairfoir‚ yf any os this generatioun
pretend to do it after this, I protest hc be repute rather one
that loveth his awin commoditie and the glorie of the world,
than the trewth of God, and the salvatioun of menis saullisss
