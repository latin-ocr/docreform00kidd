256 THE DIET OF AUGSBURG, 1530

Apology. . . . It pleases me well, and I know not how to better
it . . . for I cannot tread so softly and gently’ (de VVette, iv. 17).

At length, on 15 June, the eve of Corpus Christi, the Emperor
made his entry into Augsburg (Schirrmacher‚ Briqfe und Amen,
54 sqq.): and no sooner was [No. 115] theProposition (Coelestinus‚
Historia Comisiomcm Auglcsltznorum, 121) read at the first session
of 20 June, than, 22 June, ‘principes deliberatione habita iudica-
bant omnium primo agendum esse de religione' (Schirrmacher‚ op.
cit. 81 ; cf. Corpus Res. ii. 127). At the third session, 25 June, in
the Bishop’s palaoe, Melanchthon‘s Apology, henceforth to be
known as [No. 116] The Confession of Augsburg (Corpus Regfi
xxvi. 263 sqq.) was presented over the signatures of seven princes
and two eines, and read to the assembled Estates. Conciliatory in
tone, it made a favourable impression upon individua] opponents.
But the majority, as a whole, remained unconvinced : and, 26June‚
supported by [No. 117] the representations of the Legate(Lan2‚
in Bz'bliollzele des literariscleen Vereins in Stultgart, xi. 4 5 sqq.),
recommended the Emperor to have it examined (Schirrmaeher‚
ej). cst. 98). Its author, at an interview, 28 July, with the Legate
(Lammer, illonumentcz maz-ana, 48) showed himself ready to make
further [No. 118) Concessions (Corpus Ref ii. 171: cf. Schirr-
macher, 51111. 2) in the interests of peace. But, 3 Aug„ at [No. 119]
the fifth session (Schirrmacher, op. cit. 168), after the reading of
the Confutation¹ (Corpus Reff. xxvii, or Francke, Libri Symbolicl
Ecclesiae Lutlzermzae, app. No. 3), the Emperor demanded sub-
mission. A fresh series of negotiations (Schirrmacher‚ op. cil.
217 sqq), indeed, was taken in hand, 16 Aug., by mixed committees
of theologians and laymen (ibid. 239 sqq), which led, on Eck’s part,
to some remarkable modifications in the statement of traditional
doctrine, e. g. [No. 120] the Articulus de Missa (ibid. 234). But
negotiation was seen to be futile when, 26 Aug„ Luther repudiated
it in his [No. 121] letter from Coburg (de Wette‚ iv. 146); and on
7 Sept. [No. 122] an Imperial announcement (Schirrmacher,
op. cit. 257, cf. Forstemann, Urkundenbuch, ii, No. 179) put an
end to the business by promising a Council and requiring conformity
till it met. This policy was then embodied‚ 22 Sept„ in [No. 123]
the Recess of the Diet (Goldasti Consl. Imp. iii. 513; cf. Fo'rste-
mann, op. cst. ii, No. 206, and Schirrmacher, os). cz't. 309). Next
day the Elector lest Augsburg.

No. 112. Campeggio‘s Instructions to the
Emperor, Jan. 1530.

‘The Cardinal remarkS‚' says Ranke‚ ‘that in conformity

with the position he holds and with the Commission of the
Apostolic See, he would proceed to set forth the measures
