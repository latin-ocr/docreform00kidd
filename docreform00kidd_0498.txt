No. 221. zwingli’s letter to Rern, 30 May 1529.

Quod hactenus ad vos scripsi, iterum atque iterum facio ut
constantes sitis neque bellum metuatis. Nam ista pax quam
quidam tantopere urgent, bellum est non pax. Et bellum cui
nos instamus pax est, non bellum 3 non enim sitimus cuiusquam
sanguinem, neque etiam per tumultum hauriemus; sed in hoc
sumus, ut oligarchiae nervi succidantur. Id nisi fiat, neque
Evangelii veritas, neque illius ministri apud nos in tuto erunt.
Nihil crudele cogitamus, sed quicquid agimus amicum et
paternum est. Salvare cupimus quosdam, qui per ignorantiam
pereunt. 8611316 1111611316111 satagimus. Vos igitur nolite
abhorrere tantopere a consiliis nostris. Mitiora sunt et
aequiora quam quidam apud vos dictitant. . ..

to abolish, such as meats which God has not forbidden 10 631,
so shall it remain during the pleasure of the parishioners, and
neither side shall make war upon nor chastise the other for its
saith.

Secondly, as concerning the alliance and Union with
Ferdinand. Inasmuch as this was concluded solely for faith’s
sake, and it is now determined by the arbitrators that neither
side shall for faith's sake force, fight, or hate the other, there-
fore, before 3111 0116 moves from the field, the said Union shall

arbitrators, its seals broken, its parchment pierced and slit‚ so
that every one may see the pieces3 and the same shall be dead
and gone and done with, and neither side shall hereafter make
use of it or its like. As concerning the other Civic Alliances
