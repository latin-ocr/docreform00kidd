ξ 4. Thereupon have we [the Commissioners} the Electors‚
Princes, Estates of the Empire, and ambassadors of the same,
now here at this present Diet, unanimously agreed and re-
solved, while awaiting the sitting of the Council or a national
Assembly [i. e. without tarrying for the return of the deputation]l
with our subjects, on the matters which the Edict published by
His Imperial Majesty at the Diet holden at Worms may con-
cern, each one so to live, govern, and carry himself as he hopes

XXX
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE LUTHERAN
COMMUNITIES, 1526—9

The years that followed the Recess of Speier were years of
reconstruction. This was possible (1) because the Hapsburgs were
preoccupied with politics. Thus (a) the Emperor was absorbed in
his quarrel with the Pope, which led to the sack of Rome, 6 May
1527, and his second war with Francis, 1528—9‚ and (b) his brother
Ferdinand in the effort to secure his position on the eastern frontier
of the Empire. Though heir, by right of his wife, Anne of Poland,
†1547‚ to both the thrones of her brother Louis, Ferdinand thought
well to secure them by election‚ and so he was crowned King of
Bohemia 24 Feb„ and of Hungary 3 Nov. 1527. Henceforth his
adversary was not Lutheranism‚ but the Turk. It was further
possible (2) because the Lutherans thus found themselves free to
put their own interpretation upon the Recess. They claimed e. g.
at the Synod of Homberg, 20 Oct. 1526, that according to it they
might make ecclesiastical regulations ‘ de quibus parati sumus Deo
et Caesari ex Dei verbo reddere rationem’ (Richter, Kz'rcllen-
ordnungen, i. 56).

Ι. In 1525, Prussia, though outside the Empire, led the way.
Margrave Albert of Brandenburg, †1568‚ who, as Grand Master‚
1511—25, of the Teutonic Order, lived in Konigsberg and ruled
over Eastern Prussia, secularized its territories and received them
back as an hereditary Dukedom under the suzerainty of Poland
9 April 1525 (Tschackert, Urlezmdenlmclz z‘m‘Rejsormalz'mlsgeschiclllc
des Herzogtlmms Premsen, No. 344, vol. ii. 116). The lands of
the order were covered by two dioceses, and by this time had been
reformed through the efforts of two bishops. George von Polentz‚
Bishop of Samland, 1519—†50, put out a [No. 91] Mandate of

¹ Of the Diet to the Emperor. It was resolved upon 7 Aug. The minutes

of the Diet and its instructions sor the deputation are given in Friedensburg,
op. cil„ Anh. XII, XIII.
