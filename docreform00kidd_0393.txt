A. ZWINGLI AND CALVIN'
I
SWITZERLAND IN 1513

Switzerland in 1513 was the seat of a confederation of thirteen
cantoris.

(i) Geographically‚ all lay north and west of the line which
runs from NE. to SW. and is formed in the one direction by the
upper valley of the Rhine‚ and, in the other, of the Rhone. All
too, save Freiburg, were contained in the district bounded by the
head-waters of the Rhine and by its tributary the Aar. Thus,
twelve belonged to Rhineland and were German-speaking. To the
south-west, between the lakes of Neuchatel and Geneva, lay the
thirteenth, Freiburg; and, beyond it, districts opening out towards
France and Savoy. They were French—speaking.

(ii) Politically, the Consederation arose out of conflict with the
House of Hapsburg3 and began, 1 Aug. 1291, with a league of
three cantonS‚ Uri, SchwyZ, and Unterwalden (Oechsli, Quellen-
buch zur Schweizergesclzz'clzle 2, i. No. 21). These were per-
manently united, 9 Dec. 1315, in the league of the Three Forest
Cantons (ibid, No. 30). By the admission, 7 Nov. 1332, of
Luzern (z'bz‘d., No. 34), they became four, round the Vierwald-
st'attersee ; and by the addition, 27 June 1352, of Zug (ibici, No. 43),
the Five Forest Cantons. The five were presently increased to
eight, when they extended their alliance, 4 June 1352, to Clarus
(ibid, No. 41), and the two Imperial Cities of, 1 May 1351, 21111011
(ibini, No. 39), and, 6 March 1353, Bern (ibim, No. 44). The
Confederation‚ famous already for the victories by which it had
vindicated its independence, increased its membership by, 22 Dec.
1481, treaty with Freiburg and Solothurn (ibici, No. 82), and its
military reputation by conquests: till, after the inclusi0n‚ 9 June
1501, of a third Imperial City‚ Basel (ibid, No. 99), and, 10 Aug.
1501, of Schaffhausen (ibid, No. 102), the Consederates were
honoured, 5 July 1512, by a bull of Julius II (ibici, No. 106) with
the title Defensores ecclesiasticae libertatis, and courted by the
great powers of Europe as, 11 Aug. 1512, at [No. 150] the Diet
of Baden (z'bz'd.¹‚ No. 106). Next year, 17 Dec. 1513, by [No.
151] the League with Appenzell (ibid.2‚ No. 109), the Con-
federation reached the limit at which it remained for three hundred
years, of thirteen cantons- practically‚ though not technically, free
of the Empire. This freedom had much to do with the rapid
growth of movements for reform in Switzerland by contrast with
their slower progress in Germany.
