 

CAPPEL, 1529—31 469

Again, the dominance of the Emperor seemed overwhelming.
In face of it, the Elector accepted the Eucharistic tenets of the
Tetrapolitana, and the four cities found refuge, 27 Feb. 1531, with
the Schmalkaldic League (supra, No. 124) ε but Zwingli‚ 12 Feb„
repudiated their doctrine (Opera, viii. 579 : cf. Ranke, Res. 652 sq.).
Then, aided by fears of Imperial invasion (ibid. 593), he was all sor
renewal of the war with the Five Forest Cantons (ibid. 586). Bern
thought it sufficient, 15 May, to stop their supplies (Bullinger, ii,
ξ 377). But even this meant war. In straits sor food the Foresters
crossed the border: defeated Ziirich 11 Oct. (ibid. iii, ἕξ 436-7)
and lest Zwingli dead, on the field of Cappel (ibid. 445). On
20 Nov. [N ο. 227] the second Peace ofCappel (ibid. Β 48 5) trans-
ferred the advantage to the Catholic side: Zwingli was succeeded
by Bullinger‚ 1504-’1-75, as antistes at Ziirich and Oecolampadius,
† 24 Nov. 1531, by Oswald Myconius 1488—†1552 at Basel. The
spread of reform in German Switzerland came suddenly to an end

(ibid. iii, pp. 352 sq.).

No. 220. The christian Civie Auiance,
25 Dee. 1527.

We the Burgomasters, Little and Great Councils, Citizens
and whole Communes of the cities of Ziirich and Constance, do
all and singular to wit by these presents. . . .

In order that this Civic Alliance may be in every way for the
best and, so far as it extends, be understood, we have thought
it well to explain the same by the articles hereinafter written 2

And first, whereas saith and the salvation of souls rests in no
man's might or power but is a free and unmerited grace and
gift of God, therefore we of either part, viz. each in his own
dominions‚ are so to bear and behave ourselves in matter of
saith and the salvation of 501115 as to keep true to God and in
accord with Holy Scripture 3 contrary to which neither party is
to be allowed to afflict or attack the other or to help any one
else, whoever he be, that presumes to act contrary thereto‚
whether by advice or in any way. But should it befall either
party to be subdued, in matter of saith or evangelical doctrine,
by any one, be he who he may 3 or should any one presume to
do 115, 0111· goods and chattels‚ any hindrance, damage, or hurt, or
to overrun or invade 115, or to treat 115 unjustly in any way, let
it be from what cause soever, then we are, either party and,
moreover, each at his own eost, with our bodies and goods to
help, protect and, with all our resources, to assist the other. . .
