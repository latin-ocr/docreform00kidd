(2) Correspondence of Bislzop Brask with tlze King, 1524.⁵

(α) lee Bz'slzop, 21 May.—‘ By the allegiance which I owe
you, I deem it my duty to urge you not to allow the sale of
Luther’s books within the realm, nor give his pupils shelter
or encouragement of any kind, till the coming council of the
Church shall pass its judgement. . . . Ι know not how your
Grace can better win the love of (lod, as well as of all
Christian Kings and Princes‚ than by restoring the Church
of Christ to the state of harmony that it has enjoyed in
ages past.'

(b) Tlce King‚ 8 June.——‘ Regarding your request that we
forbid the sale of Luther's writings‚ we know not by what
right it could be done, for we are told his teachings have not
yet been found by impartial judges to be false. Moreover,
since writings opposed to Luther have been circulated through-
out the land, it seems but right that his too should be kept
public, that you and other scholars may detect their fallacies
and show thern to the people. Then the books of Luther
may be condemned. As to your charge that Luther’s pupils
are given shelter at our court, we answer that they have not
sought it. If indeed they should, you are aware it is our duty
to protect them as well as you. If there be any in our
protection whom you wish to charge, bring your accusation
and give their names.'

No. 75. The Disputation at Upfsaleu 27 Dec. 1524.

Prop. I. An religio, recepta usuque longo servata, sit abro-
ganda, ut etiam tollantur ritus ab ecclesia instituti?

Resp. D. Galle. Propositio continet duas partes. 1a est de
dogmate. Christiana religio defendit S. Scripturam, quam
rite exponunt antiqui patres Nam cum S. Scriptura sit intel-
lectu difficilis, etiam tractet obscuriora, teste Apostolo Petro,
2 Pet. iii. [15 sq.] 3 intelligere autem obscuriora sine interprete
nemo praesumit, quod exemplo Aethiopis eunuchi, Act. viii.
[31] liquet3 suntque vetusti interpretes sanctissimi viri, dicente
Apostolo, 2 Pet. i. [21] quibus singularia dona sunt collata, re-
ferente Paulo 1 Cor. xii : ergo qui dogma illorum a Spiritu sancto
ingestum negat, is Spiritui S. resistere deprehenditur, nec veram
