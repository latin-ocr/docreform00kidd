persons, unless they venture to preach, persuade, and to take
part publicly in congregations and assemblies. All other such
persons are allowed to live, and some have been set at liberty,
and released from the prisons of Paris and of other parts of
the kingdom. A great number of these last have still remained
in the kingdom, preaching and speaking publicly‚ and boasting
that they have gained their cause against the Papists‚ as they
delight to style their adversaries: so that, now, every one of
them is assured against the sear of being questioried: and there
exists thus a silent truce, because whilst formerly all suspected
persons had to quit the kingdom, and to retire some to Geneva,
some to Germany, and some to England‚ now they not only
do not leave the country, but a large number of those who
had already emigrated have returned. It was told me, whilst
passing through Geneva on my way to Italy, that, after the
death of the king, a great number of gentlemen who had fled
thither after the conspiracy of Amboise,¹ had come back to
France, and, in particular, M. de Mombrun, who was the
author of the late disturbances in Provence and in Dauphiny,
and who had been burnt in effigy ς besides these, more than
fifty others, who are called ministers, were summoned from
various parts of F rance to travel‚ and teach and preach the
⁵ Word ⁷, for thus they term the Gospels,and their own doctrine.
Your Serenity will hardly believe the influence and the great
power which the principal minister of Geneva, by name
Calvin‚ a Frenchman, and a native of Picardy⁷ possesses in
this kingdom, he is a man of extraordinary authority, who
by his mode of life, his doctrines, and his writings‚ rises
superior to all the rest ς and it is almost impossible to believe the
enormous sums of money which are secretly sent to him from
France to maintain his power. It is sufficient to add that if
God does not interfere, there is great and imminent danger
that one of two things will happen in this kingdom: either
that the truce, which is desired and sought publicly‚ will end
by the heretics having churches wherein they can preach, read,
and perform their rites‚ according to their doctrine, without
hindrance, and in like manner as they obtained churches by
command of the late king,2 given at Fontainebleau, at the end
of August,³ in compliance with a petition presented to him by
the Admiral,·⁴ or, else, that we shall see an obedience to the
