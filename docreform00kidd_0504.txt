hereafter, throughout their cities, hands, territorias, and lordships,
all evil devices, evasions, deceit, and fraud being dismissed and
put away. And we, in our turn, os the Five Cantons will also
let our Consederates os Ziirich and their allies abide by their
saith. . . .

Secondly‚ we of both sides shall allow each party to stand
sully possessed of all liberties‚ lordships, and jurisdictions which

we have in the common lordships and bailiwickS, severally ,ιῐ

without let or hindrance. It is also further resolved and ζ’
concluded between both parties, that is, in these common ·

lordships, any parish, commune, or lordship desire to receive
the new saith and to abide thereby, it may be suffered to do
so: but is any os those, who have received the new saith, desire
once more to turn theresrom and receive again the old true
Christian saith, then they shall, severally without let or hindrance,
have free permission‚ full right, power, and authority so to do.
SimilarIy, is any one in the aforesaid lordships shall not yet have
renounced the old saith, whether secretly or openly, he shall be
allowed to abide by his old saith without opposition or hatred.
Is, moreover, in one or more places it should be desired to set
up again and maintain the seven sacramentS, the celebration
of the Holy Mass and other ordinances and ceremonies of the
Christian Church, then they shall and may do so and niaintain
them, no less than the other side its preachers‚ The church
goods also and the property os the benefice shall be assigned
at a fixed rate to the priest, and the balance handed over to
the preachers. Neither party shall revile or abuse the other
because os its saith: and whosoever shall do otherwise shall
be punished by the magistrate, according to the nature of the
ossence.

Fourthly, we os Ziirich shall and will withdraw ourselves
from the newly established Civic Alliances which we have
made with any one whether os our Consederation or among
foreign lords and cities, and will regard them on our part as
dead, gone, and done with, in accordance with our sworn
league, inasmuch as the said sworn league is incompatible with
such Civic Alliances, provided we desire to be Consederates.
'l'heresore we shall and will from this moment and forthwith
surrender into the hands os the Five Cantons the documents
os the said Civic Alliance, together with the afore-established
Peace and the papers thereos, as dead, abofished, and no rnore
worth.
