When they agree by publike decree to deliver souldiers, the
Cantons chuse among themselves a Captaine generall, to whom
they give the banner with the Ensign and name publike.
Their unitie and the glory of their armes hath made famous
the name of this so savage and barbarous a nation: insomuch
as by their naturall valour, joyned to due discipline and order,
they have not only at all times valiantly defended their own
country, but have also employed themselves in forreine wars,
and performed singular feates of armes to their perpetuall
praise 3 which had been without all comparison far greater,

residue, they fell at last and that not long since, to manifest
warres among themselves, much to the diminution of the
authoritie which they bare in the world. Somewhat below
these be certaine townes and villages inhabited by a people
called Valesians‚¹ as having their'dwellings in valleys 3 they are
inferior to the Swissers in number, in publike authoritie‚ and
in valour, for that in the judgement of all men they are not so

these, another sort of people called Grisons‚² which are
