96 RADICALISM AT WITTENBERG, 1521-2 48

He will glory freely and joyously in the God who has humbled
the Pope, and begin a game with the Cardinal of Mainz that
he did not much expect. Act together, dear Bishops! Ye
may remain lordlings 1 But ye shall neither silence nor deafen
this spirit. Such disgrace shall befall you from it as ye now
little look for ! So Ι would have you warned. . . .

To this Ι request and await a str'aightforward‚ speedy answer
from Your Electoral Grace, within fourteen days. For after
fourteen days my book ‘Against the idol in Halle' will be
published‚ unless a plain answer be made me. . . .

(ὧ), The Elector of Μαίνῃ] to Lutlzer, 21 Dec. 1521.——Dear Sir
Doctor, Ι have received and read your letter. . . and taken it all

the grace of God. I cannot deny that I arn a poor sinful man,
who can sin and err, and daily do sin and err.

sententiae suae nobis exposuerunt ac intelleximus his vere de
causis eos Missas privatas in suo coetu abrogasse, quas C. V.
ex hac illorum scheda cognoscet.

perniciosus et impius abusus, tam apud sacris initiatos quarn
profanos homines, ut evelli nequeat ex animis tarn insita
penitus opinio, videlicet, quod Missa tanquam bonurn opus
quo placaturi Deum λύτρον seu pretium illi offeramus pro
peccatis nostris et aliorum recepta est, idque adeo ut sacrificu-
lus, vivens in proposito mortalis peccati, salubriter et fructuose
putetur eam caeteris applicare. Propterea Augustiniani inter-
miserunt Missae celebrationem, cum talia Missarum spectacula
sint re ipsa nervus, basis et fons horum abusuum, cupiuntque
