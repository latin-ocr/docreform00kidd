intelligant et moveantur ut Romanam Ecclesiam pure colant,
et non illorum temeritatem huic imputent: neque meam
asperitatem imitentur adversus Romanam Ecclesiam, qua ego
usus sum, imo abusus et excessi adversus balatrones istos: si
qua tandem gratia Dei, vel eo studio rursum sopiri queat
excitata discordia. Nam id unicum a me quaesitum est, ne
avaritiae alienae foeditate pollueretur Ecclesia Romana mater
nostra, neve populi seducerentur in errorem, et caritatem
discerent posthabere indulgentiis. Caetera omnia, ut sunt
neutralia, a me vilius aestimantur. Si autem et plura facere
potero aut cognovero, sine dubio paratissimus ero. Christus

THE DISPUTATION AT LEIPZIG, 1519

Ten days after his letter to Leo X Luther wrote to the Elector
declaring that he himself had intended ‘the game should come to
an end ², but that, as Eck had now attacked him, itwas not sair his
mouth should be closed and another allowed to speak (de Wette,
i. 237).

John Maier, 1486—†1543‚ known as Eck from his birthplace,
a Bavarian village of that name, became, 1517, Professor of
Theology and Vice—Chancellor of the University of Ingolstadt.
He was also Canon of Eichstadt, and a ‘disputator acerrimus ’.
In 1518, when on a visit to Gabriel von Eyb, Bishop of Eichstadt‚
1496—†1535, and Chancellor of Ingolstadt‚ Eck was asked for
an opinion in writing on Luther’s Ninety—five Theses. He made
a selectiora, and sent it to the Bishop, with animadversions‚ in his
Obelisci. The selection fell into Luther's hands by 24 March 1518
(de VVette‚ i. 100), and in August he replied with Asterz'scz' (Lutherz'
Op. Lat. i. 410 500. ; Loescher, ii. 333 sqq.).

At this point Andrew Bodenstein, 1480-†1541, called Carlstadt
from his birthplace in Franconia, intervened. Summoned to Witten-
berg, 1504, he was lecturing 2'72 via leamae 1507, and as Professor
of Theology and Archdeacon, 1510, was one of Luther's ‘most
violent opponents' till 1517, when he put out 152 Theses ‘con-
cerning nature, laW‚ and grace, against the Schoolmen’, of which
Luther wrote in high terms (de Wette, i. 55). They were now allies‚
and in May and June 1518 Carlstadt submitted 406 Conclusiones
(Loescher‚ ii. 78 500.) against Eck ancl Tetzel, the twelfth of
which asserts ‘Textus Bibliae non modo uni pluribusve ecclesiae
doctoribus sed etiam totius ecclesiae auctoritati praefertur’ (ibid.
80). These provoked from Eck a Defensio, which contained
