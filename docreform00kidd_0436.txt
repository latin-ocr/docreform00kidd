and so an end be put to all other nonsense‚ as agreed: all,

and Sermons are over, then no priest‚ regular or secular, shall
after that go to the nunnery, unless it be to provide any sick
ladies therein with Confession or the Sacraments. . .

THE DrsPUTATIONs AT ZURICH, 1523

In 1523 two Disputations carried reform further under the
authority of the Town Council.

The first (Bulling 61, Raymflmatmnsaesclzchlzte ἕξ 54- 91 and for
the Actz, in German, C. R. lxxxviii. 442 sqq„ or in Gualther's
[1519— —†86] Latin translation, menglzz Opera, i. 137 599.) was fixed
for 29 January in a [No. 185] Proclamation (ibzd. i. 140), of
3 Januar,y giving the terms of reference, to Scripture only, and
Zwingli prepared for it by the publication, 19 Jan„ of [No. 186]
Sixty- seven Articles (zbzssd i. 176· Niemeyer, Collectm consesszo-
num Ref. eccl„ 3 599.; and, 1111116 original German, C. R. lxxxviii.
458 599.) 111 which he deduced from this standard (Arts. 1- 16),
a criticism of existing doctrine and practice (Arts. 17— —,33) at
a moment when 111616ῠ1νε15 on its way to him, 23 Jan„ a flattering
[No. 187] Letter from Adrian VI (Op pera, vii. 26'6). On the
29th the discussion was opened by an [No. 188] Address from
the Burgomas‘ter (Op‘ra, i. 141; C. R. lxxxviii. 483): and the
[No. 189] First Disputation (Opem, i. 141- -;8 C. R. lxxxviii.
485 sqq.) mainly between Zwingli and Dr. Johannes Faber [Hei-
gerlin, alias Schmid, 1478 †1541], since 1518 the Vicar of the
Bishop of Constance, then proceeded till, after dinner, the Council
covered its preacher and his Articles bya [No. 190] Decree (Bul-
linger, op. czsst i, ξ 6ο; Zuz'ng liz Ofienz, i. 167, C. R. lxxxviii.
469), requiring all preacheis in its territories to conform to the
above standard.

Changes thereupon set in apace. Clergy married, 28 April
(Bullinger, op. cll. i, ξ 63). Nuns were allowed to leave the cloister,
17 June (Egli, Aktensmmnlzmg, No. 366), and were married, one
to a chaplain of the Minster, 24 June (Bullinger, op. cit. 1, § 63).
The Bishop was powerless: he could only make his protest in
a [No. 191] Pastoral (Strickler‚ Aklensammlang, 1. No. 628) of
10 July. Zwingli, on the contrary, now had a position publicly
authorized. Η6 re· -inforced his Articles, 14 July‚ by an Explana-
lton (Opem, i. 190 599.· C. R. lxxxviii. 1 sqq.), but it had to be
accompanied, 30 July‚ by a tractate (Oper z, i. 437 sqq. C. R.
lxxxix. 459 sqq )‚ intended to head off a 161 olutionary party. On
