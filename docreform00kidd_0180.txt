152 THE BEGINNINGS OF REFORM 74

papal interest. By the Massacre of Stockholm‚ 8-11 Nov.,
Christian thought to suppress the patriots and secure the Union.
But it roused a spirit at once anti-papal and nationaL which, aster
his dethronement‚ 1521, and a war of independence, 1521—3,
placed Gustavus Vasa, 1523—60, on the throne. Gustavus was
elected, 7 June 1523, by the Diet of Strengnas. Since 1519,
Strengn'as had been the centre from which reforming doctrines
had been propagated by the brothers Olaus, 1497—†1552‚ and
Laurentius Petri, 1499—†1573, lately returned from Wittenberg.
Olaus received preferment in the cathedral from Laurentius
Andreae, 1480—†1552, then administrator of the diocese. All three
might now be usesul to the King‚ who wanted the wealth of the
Church with its 7 Sees and 5ο Religious Houses (VVeidling, Schwe-
dische Gesclziclcte, 36 sqq.) to pay his debts for the war to Lijbeck,
and sor the maintenance of his throne. Accordingly, in spite of
the opposition of the hierarchy led by [No. 74] John Brask,
Bishop of Linkoping‚ 1513-28 (cf. Handlingar rob-ande Skandi-
naviens Historia, vol. xviii. 236, and Watson, The Swedz'slz Revela-
tion mederGustavus Vasa, 161 sq.)‚ he appointed Laurentius Andreae
Chaneessor, June 1523, Olaus Petri preacher at and recorder of Stock-
holm‚ and his brother Laurentius professor ¹ at Upsala. Here, with
a view to breaking down the attachment osthe people to the old re-
ligion [No. 75]‚ a disputation was arranged, 27 Dec. 1524, at which,
against Dr. Galle, Provost of Upsala, as champion of the existing
order, Olaus maintained the Lutheran opinions (Baaiius, Inventa-
νίκη] Ecclesiae §veo-Gothorum, 165 sqq„ Lincopiae, 1642).
