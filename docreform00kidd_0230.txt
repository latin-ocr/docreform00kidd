202 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 95

to it is not yet ready. Only, as one knows, make a start one
way and several ways and means will be discovered.

Fast-days, Palm Sunday, and Holy Week may be retained.
Not that we would compel any one to fast 3 but that the
reading of the Passion and the Gospels appointed sor these
times should be observed. But we would not keep the Lenten
veil, strewing of palms, covering up of pictures, and all the other
mummery, nor sing the four Passions, nor preach on the
Passion for eight hours on Good Friday. Holy week must be
like other weeks‚ except that there should be sermons on the
Passion for an hour daily throughout the week, or on as many
days as is convenient, with reception of the Sacrament by
all who desire it. For with Christians everything should be
kept in God’s service that has to do with the Word and the
Sacrament.

To sum up, this and every other order is so to be used that
should any misuse arise in connexion therewith, it should be
immediately done away with and another made: just as King
Hezekiah broke up and did away with the brazen serpent,
which God Himself had commanded to be made, because the
children of Israel misused it. Forms and Orders should be
for the promotion of faith and the service of love, and not to
injury of saith. When they have no more to do, they are
forthwith dead and of no more worth 3 just as, if good coin is
counterfeit, for sear of misuse it is abolished and destroyed3
or as, when new shoes have become old and dry, we wear
thern no longer but throw thern away and buy new ones
Order is an outward thing. Be it as good as it may, it can
fall into misuse. Then it is no longer order but disorder. So
no Order has any intrinsic worth of its own, as hitherto the
l'opish Order has been thought to have. But all Order has
its life, worth, strength, and virtue in right use: else it is
worthless and fit for nothing. God's Spirit and grace be with
us all. Amen.
