178 THE WEAKENING OF THE 83

fathers were required only to serve according to the word
of God.

The Seventh Article.-—Seventh‚ we will not hereafter allow
ourselves to be farther oppressed by our lords, but will let
thern demand only what is just and proper according to the
word of the agreement between the lord and the peasant.
The lord should no longer try to force more services or other
dues from the peasant without payment‚ but permit the peasant
to enjoy his holding in peace and quiet. The peasant should,
however, help the lord when it is necessary, and at proper
times, when it will not be disadvantageous to the peasant, and
for a suitable payment.

The Eighth Article.--In the eighth place, we are greatly
burdened by holdings which cannot support the rent exacted
from them. The peasants suffer loss in this way and are
ruined, and we ask that the lords may appoint persons of
honour to inspect these holdings, and fix a rent in accordance
with justice, so that the peasant shall not work for nothing,
since the labourer is worthy of his hire.

Γ he Ninth Article —In the ninth place, we are burdened
with a great evil m the constant making of new laws. We are
not judged according to the offence, but sometimes with great
ill will, a'nd sometimes much too leniently. In our opinion
ue should be judged according to the old written law, so that
the case shall be decided according to its merits, and not with

artiality.

p The Γ enth Article. —In the tenth place, we are aggrieved
by the appropriation by individuals of meadows and fields
which at one time belonged to a community. These we will
take again into our own hands. It may, however, happen
that the land uas rightfully purchased, but when the land
has unfortunately been purchased in this way, some brotherly
arrangement should be made according to circumstances.

Tho Eleventh A.rticle ——In the eleventh place we will
entirel) abolish the due called Todfall [i. e. heriot], and will
no longer endure it, nor allow widows and orphans to be thus
shamefully robbed against Gods will, and in violation os
justice and right, as has been done in many places, and by
those who should shield and protect them. These have
disgraced and despoiled us, and although they had little
authority, they assumed it. God will suffer this no more,
but it shall be wholly done away with, and for the future no
man shall be bound to give little or much.
