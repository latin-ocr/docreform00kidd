A PRAYER FOR THE WHOLE ESTATE oF CHRIST’S CHURCH.

ALMIGHTY Gon, and most merciful Father‚ we humbly
submit ourselves, and sall down before thy Majesty, beseeching
Thee, srom the bottom of our hearts, that this seed of Thy
Word now sown among us may take such deep root, that
neither the burning heat of persecution cause it to wither,
neither the thorny cares of this lifedo choke it, but that, as
seed sown in good ground, it may bring forth thirty, sixty‚ and
an hundred sold, as Thy heavenly wisdom hath appointed.
And because we have need continually to crave many things
at Thy hands, we humbly beseech Thee, O heavenly Father‚
to grant us Thine Holy Spirit to direct our petitions, that they
may proceed from such a fervent mind as may be agreeable to

and compassed, let Thy strength, O Lord, sustain our weak·
ness, that we, being defended with the force of Thy grace,
may be safely preserved against all assaults of Satan, who
goeth about continually like a roaring lion, secking to devour
us. Increase our saith, O merciful Father‚ that we do not
swerve at any time from Thy heavenly Word, but augment in
us hope and love with a careful keeping of all Thy command-
ments‚ that no hardness of heart, no hypocrisy‚ no concupi-
scence of the eyes, nor enticements of the world, do draw us
away from Thy obedience. And seeing we live now in these
most perilous times, let Thy fatherly providence defend us
against the violence of all our enemies‚ which do everywhere
pursue us3 but chiefly against the wickcd rage and furious
uproars of that Romish idol, enemy to Thy Christ.

Furthermore, forasmuch as by Thy holy Apostle we are
taught to make our prayers and supplications for all men, we
pray not only for ourselves here present, but beseech Thce
also to reduce all such as be yet ignorant from the miserable
captivity of blindness and error to the pure understanding of
Thy heavenly truth, that wc all with one consent and unity of
minds may worship Thee our only God and Saviour z and that
all Pastors, Shepherds, and Ministers to whom Thou hast
committed the dispensatim of Thy holy word, and charge of
