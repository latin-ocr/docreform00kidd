ARRIVAL OF FAREL, 4 OCT. 1532 495

when the authority of the See was weakened rather than advanced
by dependence upon Savoy. Three of the grandsons of Amadeus
VIII became bishops in succession3 Peter, as a child of ten, from
1451-†8‚ John Louis of twelve, from 1460-†82 and Francis, 1484-
†90. Then two great-grandsons, Philip (afterwards Duc de
Nemours †1533) at the age of seven, 1495-†1510 and Francis' son
John, 1513-†22, ‘the Bastard of Savoy.’ Meanwhile, 1504, Duke
Charles III, 1504—†53, had seized the temporal rights of the see.
Thus, at the opening os the sixteenth century, Duke and Bishop
were related technically as minister to ecclesiastica] superior, but
actually as master to dependant (cf. MS. of F. Bonivard [1493-
†1570; from 1514, Prior of St. Victor; 1530—6‚ ‘the prisoner of
Chillon ⁹] quoted in Ruchat, i. 317—23). The Reformation had
scarce a friend in Geneva when a revolution swept Duke and
Bishop away. In 1519 the patriots, led by Philip Berthelier, called,
6 Feb„ Freiburg into alliance ; whence their name of Eidgenossen ¹
(Bonivard, Chroniques de Geniwe, ΙΙΙ, c. xxi: vol. ii, 331 sq. ed.
1831). The Duke broke it up, relying upon the Mamelukes, as his
party was called (z'bz'd.); and, 23 Aug„ had [No. 243] Berthelier
beheaded (ibid, ΙΙΙ, c. xxviii: ii. 360 sq.)‚ But this was to give
the burghers a martyr for Genevan liberty ; and a patriotic reaction
set in. Alarmed for the safety of Piedrnont after the Emperor's
victory at Pavia, 24 Feb. 1525, the Duke left Geneva (ibid. IV, c.
iii: ii. 411) on 12 Dec. ; and the citizens supported, 8 Feb. 1526, by
[No. 244] an alliance with Bern as well as Freiburg ² (Oechsli,
Quellenbuch, i, No. 129 : and Spon, iii, No. lx) secured, like Bern,
a Council of Two Hundred (Bonivard, ΙΙΙ, c. ix: ii. 449) and the
civil jurisdiction of the now vacant Vidomnate besides. This last
they obtained 15 July 1527 as a concession from [No. 245] Pierre
dela Baume (ibid. IV, c. xv: ii. 468) their new bishop, 1522-†44‚
‘Idem episcopus dat potestatem syndicis et consiliariis cognoscendi
in quibuscunque causis et quaestionibus motis et movendis inter
cives et burgenses' (Gaberel, L'Eglz'se de Geneva i, app„ 20 n. 3).
The Bishop, repenting, lest the city (Bonivard, 111, c. xv : ii. 474) ;
and, 1528, went over to the Duke (ibid. IV, c. xxi: ii. 500), who
had seized some of his benefices. On 28 Νον. 1529 the Council of
Two Hundred ratified the transference to officers of its own of the
powers of the Vidomne (Gaberel, i, app. 22, n. 2); and when, in
1530, the Duke attempted to win back his authority by an attack

’ on the city (cf. Ruchat, ii. 304 sq.)‚ Bern and Freiburg, 10—20 Oct.

 

(Herminjard, ii, No. 317, n. 5) forced him not only to raise the siege
but, 19 Oct. 1530, by [No. 246] the Peace of St. Julien (Oechsli,
i, No. 138) to pledge them the Pays de Vaud as security that he
would respect the liberty of the city.

Geneva was thus well on the way to independence, by the help

¹ i.e. Consederates. Bonivard has ‘Eiguenots‘ ; whence, it is thought,
Huguenots.
