349 AND WORSHIP IN SCOTLAND, 1560-4 705

in his Word, be quhilk saith we apprehend Christ Jesus, with

the graces and benefites promised in him.
Art. 16 .· Of tlze Kz'rk.—-As we beleve in ane God‚ Father,

.’ Sonne, and halie Ghaist 3 sa do we maist constantly beleeve‚

that from the beginning there hes bene and now is, and to the

' , end of the warld sall be, ane kirk, that is to say, ane company

 

and multitude of men chosen of God‚ who richtly worship and
imbrace him be trew saith in Christ Jesus, quha is the only
head of the same kirk, quhilk alswa is the bodie and spouse
of Christ Jesus, quhilk kirk is catholike‚ that is, universal, because
it conteinis the elect of all ages, of all realmes, nations, and
tongues, be they of the Jewes, or be they of the Gentiles, quha
have communion and societie with God the Father‚ and with
his Son Christ Jesus, throw the sanctificatioun of his haly
Spirit: and therefore it is called the communioun, not of pro-
phane persounes‚ bot of saincts‚ quha as citizenis of the heavenly
Jerusalem, have the fruitioun of the maist inestimablc benefites‚
to wit, of ane God‚ ane Lord Jesus, ane saith, and ane bap-
tisme: out of the quhilk kirk, there is nouther lyfe, nor eternall
felicitie. And therefore we utterly abhorre the blasphemie of
them that affirme, that men quhilk live according to equitie
and justice, sal be saved, quhat Religioun that ever they have
professed. For as without Christ Jesus there is nouther lise
nor salvation 3 so sal there nane be participant theros, bot sik
as the Father hes given unto his Sonne Christ Jesus, and they
that in time cum unto him, avowe his doctrine, and beleeve into
him, we comprehend the children with the faithfull parentes.
This Kirk is invisible, knawen onelie to God‚ quha alane knawis
whome he hes chosen, and comprehends as weill (as said is)
the elect that be departed, commonlie called the Kirk Trium-
phant‚ and they that 3it live and secht against sinne and Sathan,
as sall live hereafter.

Art. 18 .· Of tlze nolis, be tlze qulzilk the trewe Kirk is decernit
fra tlte false, and qulza sall be judge of the doctrina—Because
that Sathan frorn the beginning, hes labourcd to dcck his pesti—
lent Synagoge with the title ofthe Kirk of God‚and hes inflamed
the hertes of cruell murtherers‚ to persecute, trouble and molest
the trewe Kirk and members thereos, as Cain did Abell‚ Ismael
Isaac, Esau Jacob, and the haill Pricsthcad of thc Jewcs Christ
Jesus himselfe, and his Apostles after him. It is ane thing maist
requisite, that the true Kirk be decerned fra the filthie Synagogues,
be cleare and perfite notes, least we, being deceived‚ receive and
imbrace, to our awin condemnatioun,the ane for the uther. The
