106 THE DIET OF SPEIER, 1529 243

to admit it. There were all sorts of little words slipped in
which are not tolerable or endurable to the cities, against which
they [sc. the majority in the Diet] are violent and dangerous ;
and especially that their authority and traditional jurisdiction
should be forcibly set aside, in order that the clergy (in case
the said article is accepted and granted) may continue to appoint
and to displace the preachers‚ to restore all the old abuseS‚ and
to establish new ones. . . .

No. 107. The Resolution of the Minority,
19—25 April 1529.
(a) From the protest of 19 April.

You, Well-beloved, and you, dear Lords, Cousins‚ Uncles‚
Friends, and others, know what objections we caused to be
raised, both orally and in writing, on the last day of the late
Diet, against certain points in the article for the preservation of
peace and unity in view of the religious division imminent in
the Empire, pending the Counci15 and this, although (while
holding that we then said nothing but what our conscience
requires for God’s honour and the hallowing of His Name) we

and unity aforesaid. You, Well-beloved, and you others should

good conscience and without objection, to come to an agree-

where it might by difference of opinion be perverted 3 whereby,

Elector of Saxony, proposed a conciliatory amendment to the
resolution adopted by the Grand Committee with reference
to the perversiori aforesaid and the maintenance of the said
peace, and afterwards we again set it before the said Com-
mittee, and subsequently had it submitted to you, Well-beloved,
and you others, trusting that the same proposal would have
been considered by you as a moderate and peaceful solution
and would have been accepted.

But whereas we have found that you, Well-beloved‚ and you
others persist in the maintenance of your intention; ancl
whereas (for stated and weighty reasons and objections which
we have now and at all times wished, declared, and repeated)
both sor conscience' sake and because yOU, Beloved‚ and you
