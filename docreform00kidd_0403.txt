ZWINGLI THE HUMANIST, TO 1519 375

and Leo Jud, 1482—†1542, pastor of St. Peter's, 21111011, and trans-
lator of the Scriptures. Twice in later years, 1519 and 1527,
{wingl3 recalls [No. 159] his debt to Wyttenbach (ibid. i. 2733
111. 543 .

From 1506-16 Zwingli was parish priest of Clarus, in his uncle's
deanery. Here his first literary efforts (ibid. 11. ii. 243 sqq.) were
those of a humanist and patriot against mercenary service other
than the Pope’s. But to serve the Pope contingents went from
Glarus into Italy, 1512, 1513, and 1515. Zwingli thrice accom—
panied them as chaplain, and 1135 lest an account (ibid. iv. 167)
of the first of these campaigns In 1513 he became pensionary
for Glarus, and himself accepted a papa] pension (ibid. i. 365).
At horne, these were years of the study of Greek ‘ non gloriae sed
sacratissimarum literarum ergo' (ibid. vii· 9), Of [No. 160]
enthusiasm for Erasmus (ibid. i. 314: and 3 101101 of 29 April
1516: ibid. vii. 12), and of [No. 161] liturgieal discoveries (ibid.
i. 2653 iii. 87 sq„ 92), which set him thinking on the claims of
Rome. But 1115 criticism of the pensionaries roused the French
interest at Clarus against him (ibid. vii. 165) and he moved away.

From 1516-18 he was people's priest (14 Apr. 1516: cf. Egli,
Analecta Resormatoria, i. 16) 31 [No. 162] Einsiedeln (Letter 01
13 June 1517: Opem, vii. 24). Einsiedeln was then, as now,
a famous place of pilgrimage: and it was directed by humanists
(ibid. vii. 59). Zwingli preached from the Gospel at Mass, ‘rely-

a false foundation, and supported the same from Scripture⁷ (ibid. 11.
i. 7); and wrote freely to sellow-humanists about the pardoner,
Bernhardin Samson, who, much to the disgust of Faber, 1478-
†1541, the Vicar-General of Constance (ibid. vii. 69), appeared in
Schwyz‚ August 1518. The letter, 6 Dec. 1518 (ibid. vii. 57) of
[No. 163] Beatus Rhenanus (Bild, of Schlettstadt‚ 1485-†1547)‚
in reply‚ illustrates the temper of amusement rather than of indig-
nation with which Zwingli and his circle as yet viewed the business-
It was therefore quite possible for him to accept the appointment,
1 Sept. 1518, of Acolyte Chaplain to the Pope (Egli, op. cst. i. 19),
bestowed as on a person worth retaining.

As such, too, his humanist friend and biographer, Oswald
Geisshaussler (Myconius, 1488—†1552), schoolmaster of the Great
Minster at Ziirich, pressed him on the chapter for the office of
people's priest (opera, vii. 52). Zwingli was elected 11 Dec. 1518
(ibid. 59), and admitted 1 Jan. 1519. He began to preach not, as
at Einsiedeln, on the liturgical Gospels, but in continuous expo-
sition of ‘the Gospel of Matthew, the Acts of the Apostles, the
Epistles to Timothy‚ to the Galatians and both the Epistles of
Peter' (Sermon of 30 March 1522, ‘ Concerning choice and liberty
respecting food,’ ibid. i. 36: tr. jackson, Zwingli, 448), and with-
out reference 10 1110 Fathers. Scarcely had he thus settled in
Ziirich as preacher of the New Learning when its patron [No. 164]
