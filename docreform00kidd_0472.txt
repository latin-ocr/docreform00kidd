444 THE REFORMATION COMPLETED 206

Christ's Supper lias been seriously misused, it is therefore
necessary that everything that is not in accordance with the
Word of God should be put away from it. And whereas this
memorial is a thanksgiving and a rejoicing before Almighty
God for the goodness which He has shown us through His
Son, and whosoever appears at this feast, meal, or thanksgiving
witnesses thereby that he is of those who believe that they are
redeemed by the death and blood of our Lord Jesus Christ 3
therefore on Maundy T hursday the young people who now
believe and have come to the knowledge of God and of His
Word, and desire to begin this thanksgiving and supper, must
betake themselves to the fioor of the nave between the choir
and the entrance, males to the right and females to the left,
and the rest must remain in the aisles, the porch, and other
places. As soon as the sermon is over, unleavened bread
and wine shall first be placed upon a table on the floor of the
nave, and then the ordinance and action of Christ, in accordance
with His institution of this memorial, shall be recited openly
and intelligibly, in German, as hereafter follows. T hen the
bread shall be carried round by the appointed ministers on
large wooden trenchers from one seat to the next, and each
shall break off a bit or a mouthful with his hand and eat it.
'l'hen they shall go round with the wine likewise 3 and no one
shall move from his place. When that is done, in open and
clear words praise and thanksgiving shall be offered to God
in an audible and distinct voice : and then the whole multitude
of the congregation shall say ‘Amen' at the end. On Good
Friday, people of middle life shall assemble in the place
aforesaid on the floor of the nave, and the thanksgiving shall
take place in like manner, men and women apart, as above.
On Easter Day, the old folk likewise. The trenchers and
beakers shall be of wood, that no pomp come back again.
And this order, so long as it please our churches‚ we shall
observe four times in the year, at Easter, Whitsuntide, autumn,
and Christmas.

Volo autem hic adiungere actionis formulam qua nos in
celebranda Coena utimur, quo tua Maiestas videat, Christi
nos verba non immutare, non vitiare, non perversa sententia
depravare ,· sed ea prorsus servare in Coena quae et in Missa
servari debuerant, haec sunt preces, laudes, confessio fidei,
