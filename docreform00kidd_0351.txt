by vote of the Rigsraad. Its abolition was confirmed at the Rigsdag
of Copenhagen, 15—30 Oct„ whose decisions were embodied in
a Royal Manifesto, and in a [No. 132] General Recess (N. Cragii
Annales Dam‘ae, Addit. Ι, 3 sqq.y Hafniae, 1737), setting up
‘other Christianlike bishops or superintendents that can teach and
preach the Holy Gospel '. The King then sent for Bugenhagen to
re-arrange ecclesiastical affairs. He arrived July 1537, and, writes
Luther (de Wette, v. 88), ‘quasi verus episcopus,' crowned the
King and Queen, 12 Aug. On 2 Sept„ though a mere presbyter,
he ‘ consecrated ' seven men, most of them already presbyters like
himself, to be superintendents or ‘bishops⁷ (cf. Dr. A. J. Mason,
‘The loss of the succession in Denmark ’ in T lte Clmrclz Quarlerly
Review, April, 1891); and published a new, but characteristically
conservative [No. 132 a], Church Ordinance (Cragii Annales,
Addit. ΙΙ, 29 sqq: Miinter, iii. 484 sqq), afterwards legalized by
the Diet of Odense, 1539 (ibid. iii. 508). On 9 Sept. he recon-
stituted the University of Copenhagen, appointing three professors
to lecture on the Old Testament, the New Testament, St. Augus-
tine De Spiritu et littera, Luther's Commentary on Galatians and
Melanchthon’s Locz'ffiragii Annales, Addit. iii. 101 sq. 3 Miinter‚ iii.
476 sq.). Meanwhile, the King was received into the Schmalkaldic
League, 1538 (ibid. iii. 512) as Duke of Holstein: and in 1542 the
Danish order of things was adopted in Schleswig-Holstein‚ save
that consistories took the place of ‘ bishops ⁵ (Richter, K irclzenord-

who had, at this time, four suffragans in Nonvay, the Bishops of
Bergen, Hamar, Opslo (Christiania), and Stavanger, and two in
Iceland, Holum, and Skalholt. But on 1 April, 1537, Archbishop
Olaf fied to Lierre (where he died 7 March 1538) ; and, 1 May, the
King's forces landed at Bergen. Their leader, Truid Ulfstand‚

the arrest of the Bishop of Hamar (from a contemporary source
ap. Willson, op. cil. 347), and of the other prelates. Then followed
confiscation and the substitution of ‘ superintendents' as in
Denmark.

In Iceland (Miinter, iii. 530) Gisser Einarssen became ‘bishop '
of Skalhost, 1540, and laboured to reform the Church, aster the
Danish model, till his death in 1548. There was a reacfflon,
headed by John Aresen, Bishop of Holum, 1520—†50. But he was
executed as a traitor at Skalholt, 7 Nov. 1550: and ‘the last
representatives of Catholicism disappeared from Iceland in 1552 ⁹
(Ranke, Popc's, i. 396).
