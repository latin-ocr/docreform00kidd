part, and we the Syndics, Councillors, and Burghers of the
town and Commune of Geneva, of the other part, do all to
wit, ἃς. . . .

(1) That we, each town with the others . . . for us and our
successors . . . have undertaken and accepted . . . an upright
and honest Civic Alliance¹ . . . and have also knowingly re-

ceived and adopted each other as right and resident Burghers ;
and further that we have sworn to God and the Saints, with
hand uplifted and oath on our lips, each town to deal truly
and loyally with the others, to promote their usages, honours,
and privileges, to prevent their injury, and to do all that befits
true Burghers.

show and render help and assistance each to the other, it is

of the town and Commune of Geneva, in body, honour, or
goods, its land or people, its lordships, liberties‚ good customs,
and ancient usages, or shall, in any way whatever, attempt or
take in hand to attack the same, then we the aforesaid Magis-
trateS, Councillors, and Burghers, in accordance with the oaths
we have sworn, shall consider, weigh, and decide whether such
aggression, outrage, attack, and other violence, were done
against right and equity: and should it then be found, on
examination . . . had, that such things were done, against right
and equity, with force and against the men of Geneva afore-
said, then we of Bern and Freiburg aforesaid shall be bound
to render according to our power to the men of Geneva afore-
said, when so attacked, injured, &o . . . all needful help . . .
and protection ,· but at the cost and charges of thern of Geneva.

(3) In return, we the aforesaid Syndics‚ Councillors, and
Burghers of the town and Commune of Geneva hereby engage
and agree with the Magistrates, CouncillorS, Burghers, and
Communes of the towns of Bern and Freiburg, that, should
they suffer similar aggression, attack, constraint, and affliction,
