Answer. Ι believe that Jesus Christ, very God, born of
the Father in eternity, and also very man, born of the VIrgin
Mary, is my Lord, who has redeemed me, a lost and damned
man, and has won and delivered me from all sins, from death,
and from the power of the devil‚ not with gold and silver‚
but with His holy and precious blood and with His innocent
passion and death, so that Ι might be His own, and might
live under Him in His kingdom, and serve Him in ever-
lasting righteousness‚ innocence, and blessing, just as He rose
from the dead, and lives and reigns in all eternity. This is a
faithful saying.

illuminates‚ sanctifies‚ and preserves in Jesus Christ all
Christendom throughout the earth in the one true saith ; in
which Christendom He daily bestows abundantly on me
and 311 believers forgiveness of sins; and on the last day
He will awaken me and all the dead, and will give to me
and all that believe in Christ eternal life. This is 3 faithful
saymg.
