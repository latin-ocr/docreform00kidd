CALVIN IN EXILE, 1538-41

The exiles laid their complaints, 27 April 1538, before Bern
(Herminjard‚ iv, No. 705) and before, 29 April-4 May, [No. 295]
a Synod of Ziirich (ibid. v, No. 708). The Synod advised thern
‘to moderate their misplaced rigour and to show some Christian
tender-heartedness towards a people so undisciplined’ (Opera, x b
[= C. R. xxxviii] 193) as the Genevese ; but it urged Bern to press
for their restoration (Herminjard, V, No. 713, n. 2). Bern did so,
23 May (ibid. No. 717, n. 22), and escorted them to Geneva. But
to no effect. They were forbidden, 26 May, to enter the city
(Opera, xxi. [= C. R. xlix.] 230). On 23 July (Herminjard, ν, No.
731, n. 1) Farel withdrew to NeuchateL where, save for an adven-
turous visit to Metz, 1542—3, he remained till his death, 13 Sept.
1565. Calvin, on the invitation, 1 Aug. (ibid. Nos 729), of Bucer
settled at Strassburg, where he became, 8 Sept. (ibid. No. 743, n.
103 Opera, xxi. [= C. R. xlix.] 235) pastor of French refugees at
S. Nicholas‚ and, Jan. 1539, lecturer in theology (Herminjard, v,
No. 767) with, from 1 May, a salary from the town (ibid. n. 19).
Here he brought out, 1 Aug, the second edition of the Institutio
(Opera, i. [= C. R. xxix] 2533 xxi. [= C. R. xlix] 250), which had
already placed him in the first rank among theologians; and,
18 Oct.‚ the preface (Herminjard, vi, No. 828) to his exposition of
Romans (Opera, xlix. [= C. R. lxxvii] 1 sqq.), published March
1540, whence his equal distinction among exegetes. When, there-
fore, 18 March 1539, [No. 296] Jacopo Sadoleto, 1477—†1547,
Cardinal Bishop of Carpentras‚ 1517—40‚ took advantage of their
recent dissensions to invite the Genevese to return to the Church
(ibid. v. [= C. R. xxxiii] 369 sqq.), it fell almost naturally, though
at the suggestion of Bern (Herminjard, ν, No. 811, n. 11), to,
1 Sept, [No. 297] Calvin to reply (Opera, V. [= C. R. xxxiii]
385 sqq.). His answer, which, as Luther wrote to Butzer‚ he had
read ‘ cum singulari voluptate ' (de VVette‚ ν. 211) contained an able
defence of the Reformation‚ prophetie of the standing which Calvin
was afterwards to attain as the only international Reformer. On
30 Jan. 1540 the Council in Geneva ordered it to be printed
(Opera, xxi. [= C. R. xlix.] 255); and this step marks the decline
of the party which had expelled him. On 8 Feb. new Syndics were -
