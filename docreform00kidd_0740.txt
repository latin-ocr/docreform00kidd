712 THE NEw FAITH‚ DISCIPLINE, ⁷ 351

themselves before they presume to eat of that bread, and to
drink of that cup 3 for as the benefit is great, if, with a true
penitent heart and lively saith, we receive that holy Sacrament
(for then we spiritually eat the flesh of Christ and drink His
blood, then we dwell in Christ, and Christ in us, we be one
with Christ, and Christ with us), so is the danger great if we
receive the same unworthily, for then we be guilty of the body
and blood of Christ our Saviour‚ we eat and drink our own
damnation, not considering the Lord's body, we kindle God’s
wrath against us, and provoke Him to plague us with divers
diseases and sundry kinds of death.

And therefore, in the name and authority of the eternal God,
and of His Son Jesus Christ, I excommunicate from this Table
all blasphemers of God, all idolaters‚ all murdererS, all adulterers,
all that be in malice or envy 3 all disobedient persons to father
or mother, Princes or Magistrates, Pastors or Preachers3 all
thieves and deceivers of their neighbours 3 and, finally, all such
as live a life directly fighting against the will of God: charging

but only such as continue in sin without repentance. Neither
yet is this pronounced against such as aspire to a greater per-
fection than they can in this present life attain unto 3 for,
albeit we feel in ourselves much frailty and wretchedness, as
that we have not our saith so perfect and constant as we ought,
being many times ready to distrust God’s goodness through
our corrupt nature 3 and also that we are not so thoroughly
given to serve God, neither have so fervent a zeal to set forth
His glory, as our duty requireth‚ feeling still such rebellion in
ourselves, that we have need daily to fight against the lusts of
our flesh 3 yet nevertheless‚ seeing that our Lord hath dealt
thus mercifully with us, that He hath printed His Gospel in
our hearts, so that we are preserved from falling into despera-
tion and misbelief 3 and seeing also that He hath endued us
with a will and desire to renounce and withstand our own
affections‚ with a longing for His righteousness and the keeping
of His commandments, we may be now right well assured, that
those defaults and manifold imperfections in us shall be no
hindrance at all against υς, to cause Him not to accept and
impute us as worthy to come to His spiritual Table: For the
