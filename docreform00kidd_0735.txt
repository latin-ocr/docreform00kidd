 

349 AND WORSHIP IN SCOTLAND, 1560—4 707

men before us have said or done, as unto that quhilk the halie
Ghaist uniformelie speakes within the body of the Scriptures‚
and unto that quhilk Christ Jesus himselfe did, and commanded
to be done. For this is ane thing universallie granted, that the
Spirite of God, quhilk is the Spirite of unitie, is in nathing con-
trarious unto himselfe. Gis then the interpretation, determina-
tion, or sentence of ony Doctor‚ Kirk, or Councell, repugne to
the plaine worde of God, written in ony uther place of the
Scripture, it is a thing maist certaine‚ that there is not the true
understanding and meaning of the haly Ghaist‚ although that
Councels, Realmes, and Nations have approved and received
the same. For we dare non receive or admit ony interpreta-
tion quhilk repugnes to ony principall point of our saith, or to
ony uther plaine text of Scripture, or 3it unto the rule of
charitie.

Cap. iv, ξ 1. In a Church reformed, or tending to Re-
formation‚ none ought to presume either to preach, or yet
to minister the Sacraments, till that orderly they be called to
the same. Ordinarie vocation consisteth in election, examina-
tion, and admission. . . .

Cap. xvi, ξ 3. The papisticall Priests have neither power
nor authoritie to minister the Sacraments of Christ Jesus,
because that in their mouth is not the sermon os exhortation ;
and therefore to them must strait inhibition be made, notwith-
standing any usurpation they have made in the time of blind-
nesse, not to presume upon the like hereaster, as likewise to
all others who are not lawfully called to the holy Ministry‚ it
is neither the clipping of their crownes, the grensing os their
fingers, nor the blowing of the dumb dogges called thc¹ Bishops,
neither the laying on of their hands that maketh true Ministers
of Christ Jesus: but the Spirit of God inwardly first moving
the heart to seeke to enter in the holy calling for Christ's glory
and the profite of his Kirk, and thereaftcr the nomination of the
people, the examination of the learned, and publick admission
as before is said, make rnen lawfull Ministers of the Word and
Sacraments. We speak of the ordinarie vocation in Kirks
