Histmy qs the Reformation in Sweden, 213 ε cf. Weidling,
Schwedisclze Gesclziclzte im Zeitalter der Reformation, 207). The
Diet then proceeded to adopt the regulations known as the [No.
101] Westeras ordinances (summarized in Watson‚ The Swedislz
Revolution, 258 sqq.; cf. Anjou, 2163 Weidling, 208), the result
of which was to place the Church at the mercy of the King. At his
command, 5 Jan. 1528, three bishops were consecrated sor Skara,
Strengnas, and Abo, by the Catholic Bishop of Wester'as, without
indeed the confirmation of the Pope, but with the ancient, rites.
The monasteries were robbed of their property; and, sooner or
later, died out (Anjou, 226 sqq). On 2 Feb. 1529 [No. 102] a
synod met at Orebro and carried changes a stage further by its
programme of reforms, 7 Feb. (Baazius‚ Inventarmm ecclesiae
Sveo-Gotlzorum, 239 sqq.; cf. Anjou, 257 sqq., and Weidling, 241
sqq.) In 1529 there appeared a Manual, in 1530 a Hymn-book‚
and in 1531 the first Mass-book—-all in Swedish: and, as from the
hands of Olaus Petri, all Lutheran. His brother, Laurence, became
Archbishop of Upsala‚ 1531.
