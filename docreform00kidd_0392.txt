364 THE PEAcE OF AUGSBURG 149

named religions shall not be included in the present peace but
be totally excluded from it.

ξ 18. And since it has proved to be matter of great dispute
what was to happen with the bishoprics, priories, and other
ecclesiastical benefices of such Catholic priests as would in
course of time abandon the old religion, we have in virtue of
the powers of Roman Emperors ordained as follows ; Where an
archbishop, bishop or prelate or any other priest of our old
religion shall abandon the same, his archbishopric‚ bishopric,
prelacy, and other benefices, together with all their income and
revenues which he has so far possessed, shall be abandoned
by him without any further objection or delay. The chapters
and such as are entitled to it by common law or the custom
of the place shall elect a person espousing the old religion, who
may enter on the possession and enjoyment of all the rights
and incomes of the place without any further hindrance and
without prejudging any ultimate amicable settlement of re-
ligion.

ξ 19. Some of the abbeys, monasteries‚ and other ecclesias-
tical estates having been confiscated and turned into churches,
schools‚ and charitable institutions, it⁴ is herewith ordained that
such estates as their original owners had not possessed at the
time of the treaty of Passau shall be comprised in the present
treaty of peace.

ξ 20. The ecclesiastical jurisdiction over the Augsburg
Confession, doctrine, appointment of ministers‚ church usages,
orders, and ceremonies hitherto practised (but apart from all
the rights of the Electors, Princes and Estates, Colleges and
Monasteries‚ to taxes in money or tithes) shall from now cease,
and the Augsburg Confession shall be left to the free and
untrammelled enjoyment of their religion, ceremonies, appoint-
ment of ministers, as is stated in a subsequent separate article,
until the final settlement of religion shall take place.

ξ 2 3. No Estate shall try to persuade the subjects of other
Estates to abandon their religion nor protect them against
their own magistrates. Such as had from olden times the
rights of patronage are not included in the present article.

§24 In case our subjects‚ whether belonging to the old
religion or to the Augsburg Confession‚ should intend leaving
their homes, with their wives and children, in order to settle
in another place, they shall neither be hindered in the sale of
their estates after due payment of the local taxes nor injured
in their honour. . . .
