97v LUTHERAN COMMUNITIES, 1526-9 209

So thou must not establish any law herein like the Pope.
Only dwell on the good and harm, necessity and messing,
the danger and salvation, in the Sacrament‚ and then they
will come of their own accord, without your constraining
them. But if they do not come, let thern go their ways,
and tell them they are the devil’s, since they neither regard
nor feel their own great need and God’s graeious help.
But if thou do not dwell on this, or if thou make a law
and poison of it, then it is thy fault that they despise the
Sacrament. How can they be otherwise than indifferent if
thou sleep or keep silence? Therefore see to it, pastor and
preacherl Our office has now become a different thing from
what it was under the Po e: it has ᾖδ’νὶι-Εέὂὸᾞῖἆῖ real and
savin office. Therefore lt 15 more trdirbless'biiie*‘a”1{fi‘'“‘full‘df
lassour, anH 1s inore encompassed by danger and temptation‚ and,
moreover, brings little reward and thanks in this world. But
Christ Himself will be our reward if we work faithfully. And

so may the Father of all mercy help us, to whom be praise
and thanks everlasffing, through Christ our Lord. Amen.
