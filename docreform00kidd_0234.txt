206 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 97

driven by the wretched and lamentable state of affairs which Ι
discovered lately when I acted as inspector. Merciful God,
what misery Ι have seen, the common people knowing nothing
at all of Christian doctrine, especially in the villages! and
unfortunately many pastors are wellnigh unskilled and in-
capable of teaching3 and though all are called Christians and
partake of the Holy Sacrament‚ they know neither the Lord’s
Prayer, nor the Creed, nor the Ten Commandments‚ but live
like the poor cattle and senseless swine, though, now that the
Gospel is come, they have learnt well enough how they may
abuse their liberty.

O ye bishops, how will ye ever answer for it to Christ that
ye have so shamefully neglected the people, and have not
attended for an instant to your office? May all evil be averted
from you ἒ Ye forbid the taking of the Sacrament in one kind,
and insist on your human laws, but never inquire whether
they know the Lord's Prayer, the Belief, the Ten Command-
ments, or any of the words of God. Oh, woe upon you for
evermore Ι

Therefore I pray you for God⁷s sake, my good masters
and brethren who are pastors or preachers, to attend to your
office with all your heart, to take pity on your people, who
are commended to your charge, and to help us to introduce
the Catechism among the people, especially among the young3
and let those who cannot do better take these tables and forms,
and instruct the people in thern word for word 3 in this wise 1—-

Fz‘rsa the preacher must above all things beware of and
avoid the use of various and different texts and forms of the
Commandments‚ Lord’s Prayer, Belief, Sacrament, δῖε. 3 he
must take one form and keep to it, and constantly teach
the same, year after year. For the young and simple folk
must be taught one definite text and version, else they will
easily become confused, if to-day we teach thus and next year
thus, as though we wanted to improve it, and so all our
labour and toil is lost.

This was clearly seen by the worthy fathers, who used the
Lord's Prayer, the Belief, the Ten Comrnandments, all in one
form. Therefore we must always teach the young and simple
folk in such a manner that we do not alter one syllable, or
preach to-morrow differently from to-day.

Therefore choose whatever form thou wilt, and ever keep to
itt But if thou preachest to scholars or wise men, thoumayest
show thy skill, and vary these articles, and twist thern as ,subtly
