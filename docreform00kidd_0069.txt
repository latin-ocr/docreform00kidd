MILTITZ, 151 9.

On 8 Dec. 1518 the Elector Frederick, 1486—†1525, in 3 letter
to Cajetan declined the Legate’s request ‘ut Martinum Lutherum
sive Romam mitteremus sive ex nostris regionibus expelleremus’
(chtherz' Op. Lat. ii. 410), 311(1 thus took Luther once more under
his protection. In view of the coming Imperial Election it was
worth the Pope’s while to show so powerful a prince some mark
of his favour. Accordingly Charles von Miltitz (?1490—†1529)‚
by birth a Saxon nobleman, and now both papal chamberlain and
agent at Rome for the Saxon Courts‚ was appointed Nuncio 15 Oct.
1518 (Loescher, ii. 554), and sent to bring him the Golden Rose.
Miltitz left ltaly Nov. 1518; and, after interviews with Spalatin
and the Elector in December which led him to see the necessity
of disavowing Tetzel († 4 July 1519), disgraced that worthy at
Leipzig, and then went on to ARenburg, where he had 3 friendly
meeting with Luther in Spalatin's house 6 Jan. 1519. In letters
of Jan. 1519 Luther gives [No. 21] an account to the Elector of
his agreement with Miltitz (de Wette, i. 208 sq.; tr. Gieseler
v. 369); in another of 20 Feb. to Staupitz, of [No. 22] his impres-
sions of the interview (de Wette‚ i. 231 sq.); and in that of

3 March he makes, as promised, [No. 23] his submission to Leo X
(ibid. i. 233 ; Loescher, iii. 92 sqq.).

No. 21. Luther's account to the Elector of the
agreement with Miltitz.

First, that a general inhibition should be imposed on both
sides, and that both sides shall be forbidden to preach, write,
or treat of these subjects any 111016.

Secondly‚ he, Charles von Miltitz, would write to our holy
father the Pope a short account of the position of affairs, as
he had found them, and provide that the Pope's holiness
should commission some learned bishop to investigate the
case, and point out articles which are erroneous and to be
revoked by me. And if then I be shown my error‚I ought
and will gladly recant it and not weaken the honour and
authority of the Holy Roman Church. μ

In the next place, I was ready to write to the Pope's holiness,
and submit myself with all humility‚confess thatI had been too
zealous and too eager, yet with no intention to encroach on the
holy Church, but only to show the reason why, as a true son of
the Church, I had resented the wicked preaching, out of which
great ridicule, ill-reputo, dishonour‚ and discontcnt had grown
