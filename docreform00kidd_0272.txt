244 THE DIET OF SPEIER‚ 1529 107

Excellencies, in view of the imminent religious division above-
mentioned, have not reconciled yourselves to assist in the
preservation of peace and unity pending the Council, we do
not agree or consent herein 3 and whereas, from the form of pro-

Recess of Speier‚ we are not bound herein‚ especially without

our consciences, we are pledged and bound to regard before
all things the same our Lord and God, in the undoubting con-
fidence that your Royal Serenity, our beloved fellow Princes,
and the others, will in a friendly spirit hold us excused that we
are not one with you therein‚ and that we cannot in such

been urged to do in this Diet‚ especially having regard to the
fact that the Recess of the previous Diet of Speier specially
states, in the article in question, that it was adopted by a
