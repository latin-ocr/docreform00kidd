No. 46. German feeling in favour of Luther.

(1) DISPATCHES OF GASPAR CONTAR1N1‚ THE VENETIAN
AMBASSADOR.

April 2 5.—I cannot tell you how much favour he [Luther]
enjoys here [Worms]‚ and which is of such a nature that,
on the Emperor's departure and the dissolution of the Die-t,
Ι suspect it will produce some bad effect, most especially
against the prelates of Germany. In truth, had this man been
prudent, had he restricted himself to his first propositions, and
not entangled himself in manifest errors about the saith, he
would have been, I do not say favoured, but adored by the
whole of Germany. Ι was told so at Augsburg by the
Duke of Bavaria and many others, and Ι see the same by
experience.

April 26.—-Luther is a man who will not relinquish his
opinion, either through argument, fear, or entreaty. . . . He
has many powerful partisans who encourage him, and against
whom no one dares to [proceedl. . . . His books are sold
publicly in Worms, although the Pope and the Emperor, who
is on the spot, have prohibited them.

(2) LETTER oF THE ARCHBISHOP or ΜΑΙΝΖ ΤΟ
LEO X, JULY.

Beatissime Pater. . . . In dies post omnium bonorum
virorum conatum, post bullam Beatitudinis vestrae et Cae-
sareum edictum in Martinum et complices, augentur copiae
Lutheranorum, iamque rarissimi inveniuntur laici qui candide
et simpliciter faveant ecclesiasticis; sed et bona pars sacer—
dotum facit cum Luthero et plerosque pudet stare a parte
Romanae Ecclesiae, adeo invisum est nomen curtisanorum
et decretorum Beatitudinis vestrae, quae magno supercilio
post Wittembergenses et alii quoque reiiciunt. . . .
