AND WORSHIP IN SCOTLAND, 1560-4 703

⁶ filthie synagogue ' and ⁶ horrible harlot‚ the Kirk malignant1‘
[Art. 18]. But much of its language can be traced to Calvin’s
Institutes, the Genevan Confessions, and the Summa Doctrinae of
John Laski (Opera, ii. 294 sqq. ed. Kuyper). Orthodox enough on
the Trinity and the lncarnation‚ the Old Scots Confession betrays
its origin in asserting that ‘ the image of God wes utterlie desaced
in man ³ [Arl. 3] ; that the true Kirk is invisible, consisting only os
the elect [Art. 16], and has for its notes 1101ί antiquitie‚ title usurpit,
.lineal descence'‚ 13111 ‘ the trew preaching of the Worde of God . .. the
right administration of the Sacraments' and ‘ ecclesiasticaldiscipline
uprightlie ministred ’ [Art. 18]. The Confession remained the
standard of doctrine in the Kirk under both the Presbyterian and
the Episcopal regime to 1647, when it was superseded by the
Westminster Confession (Dunlop‚ i. 1 sqq: Schaff, Creeds. &va
600 5 .).
Νοῗ111 followed, from the same hands, 1560 [No. 350] the First
Book ofDiseipline (Dunlop‚ ii. 515 sqq.; Knox, Warlcs, ii. 183 sqq. ;
cf. Mitchell, c. viii) under nine heads. ln sketching the only
Scriptural polity‚ it starts from the position, already adopted by the
Book os Common Order, 1556, from Calvin’s Ordommuces ecclesia-
slz'ques (supra, No. 302) of 1541, 10 1110 effect that the permanent
office-hearers are four—Pastors, Doctors‚ Elders, and Deacons
(B. C. 0. 13 sqq„ ecl. G. W. Sprott, 1901). It is necessary, however,
‘to make difference betwixt preachers at this time ' (Fifth Head ;
Dunlop, ii. 539) : and provision is accordingly made for Superinten—
dents; the shadows, but only the shadows, of the Catholic episco-
pate. As to the ‘ admission of ministers ⁹, it is laid down that ‘ it is
neither the clipping of their crownes‚ the greasing of their fingers,
nor the blowing os the dumb dogges called the Bishops, neither the
laying on of their hands, that maketh true ministers of Christ
Jesus. But. . . the nomination of the people, the examination of
the learned, and publick admission . . . make men lawfull ministers'
(Ninth Head, ii. 603) ; nor 15 any a lawful minister but a preacher,
for the Sacraments cannot be ‘ rightlie ministrcd by him, in whose
mouth God hath put no sermon of exhortation ' (Fourth Head, ii.
530). The book, in short, rejects the traditional‚ revives the
Ephesian ², and leaves a loophole for the charismatic ministry. lt
displays as great a zeal for education (Fifth Head, ii. 547 sqq.) as
for Discipline (Seventh Head, ii. 568 500.); and the latter was
regulated by an Orcler os E.2·c0711mlcm'cczlian and of Public Rc-
pentance (Knox‚ Works, vi. 447 500.; Sprott, B. C. Ο. 35 sqq).
sanctioned in 1569 and abridged by Knox from similar formularies
of John Laski (Forma ac Ratio tola Ecclesiastscz· ᾸΙίιιίςίενίί 111
Opera, ii. 184 sqq, 194 500.) [Νο. 351] The Book of Common

¹ =ecclesia malzgnanlium, Ps. xxv. [xxvi] 5—:1 designation which Knox
had adopted in his dispute with Friar Arbuckill, 1547 (Il‘orks, i. 200).

-2 ‘In some editions of the Genevan version the word ‘⁶ eldership '‘ is thus
explained in the margin : ‘⁴ Under this name 110 containeth the whole inini-
sterie of the Church which was at Ephesus’' ' (Mitcheu, 232, n. 1).
