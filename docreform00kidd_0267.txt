XXXII
THE DIET OF SPEIER, 1529

Scarcely had the new evangelical institutions begun to take shape
when, in 1528, a Catholic reaction set in. This was due to two
causes. First‚ to the ‘violence with which Philip of Hesse, in
reliance upon the forgeries of Otto von Pack, treated the neigh-
bouring bishops (Ranke, Res. Bk. V, c. ii). It ‘stained the good
cause ², said Melanchthon : and it provoked the natural resentment
of the German Catholic sovereigns. Secondly‚ to the improved
relations of Pope and Emperor. Each had, at last, discovered
that neither could stand without the other; and both had a
common interest in putting down heresy. Hence, in response to
a papal appeal of 28 Oct. 1528 (Ranke‚ Res. 553), the Emperor, by
a [No. 103] Mandate of 30 Nov. (Ney, Gesclzz‘clzte des Reiclzstages
zu Speier, 291 sqq), convoked the Diet to meet at Speier on
21 Feb. 1529. There was a strong Catholic majority (ibid. 51 sqq.)
among the Estates present, when, on 15 March, Ferdinand com-
municated to them [No. 104] the Proposition (Walch‚ xvi. 318
sqq. 3 Ney, op. cit. 104 sqq). It was debated in committee till, on
23 March (Ney, op. cit. 128), a [No. 105] Resolution (Walch‚ xvi.
323 sqq.; Ney, 129 sqq.) was taken, which, as being in harmony
with the wishes of the majority, was adopted by the Diet on 6 and
7 April (Ney, 176). The citieS, as appears from a [No. 106]
Letter of Fiirstenberg, the ambassador of Frankfurt (Ney, 358)
resented the decision as tending to re-establish the spiritual
authority of the bishops: while six princes and fourteen cities
joined, 19 April, in the celebrated [No. 107] Protest (Walch‚ xvi.
384 ξ 2; N ey, 233) afterwards, 25 April, expanded in the Instru-
mentum A ppellatz·0nz·s (Walch‚ xvi. 390 ξ 6 ; N ey, 243) on behalf of
freedom of conscience and the rights of minorities‚ which won
sor them and their posterity ‘ the name of Protestants '-a name
that, as the English bishops observed at the Savoy Conference,
‘mqst properly belongs to those that profess the Augustan con-
fessxon’ (CardwelI, Conferences, 3383 cf. 445).
