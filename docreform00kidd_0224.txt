196 THE oRGANJzATIoN OF THE ’ 95

Who knows how God will make use of them in years to come?
It is for this end also that schools are established.

[2] Next, there is the German Alass and Divine Servt‘ce‚
of which we are now treating. This ought to be set up for the
sake of the simple laymen. Both these kinds of Service then
we must have held and publicly celebrated in church for the
people in general. They are not yet believers or Christians.
But the greater part stand there and gape, simply to see some-
thing new: and it is just as if we held Divine Service in an
open square or field amongst Turks or heathen. So sarit is
no question yet of a regularly fixed assembly wherein to train
Christians according to the Gospel: but rather of a public
allurement to faith and Christianity.

[3] But the third sort [of Divine Service]‚ which the true
type of Evangelical Order should embrace, must not be cele-
brated so publicly in the square amongst all and sundry‚
Those, however, who are desirous of being Christians in
earnest‚ and are ready to profess the Gospel with hand and
mouth, should register their names and assemble by themselves
in some house to pray, to read, to baptize and to receive the
sacrament and practise other Christian works. In this Order,
those whose conduct was not such as beflts Christians could be
recognized, reproved, reformed, rejected, or excommunicated,
according to the rule of Christ in Matt. xviii. Here, t00, a
general giving of alms could be imposed on Christians‚ to be
willingly given and divided among the poor, after the example
of St. Paul in 2 Cor. ix. Here there would not be need of
much fine singing. Here we could have baptism and the
sacrament in short and simple fashion ; and direct everything
towards the W ord and prayer and love. Here we should have
a good short Catechism about the Creed, the Ten Command-
ments, and the Lord's Prayer. In one word, is we only had
people who longed to be Christians in earnest‚ Form and
Order would soon shape itself. But Ι cannot and would not
order or arrange such a community or congregation at present.
Ι have not the requisite persons for it, nor do I see many who
are urgent for it. But should it come to pass that Ι must do
it, and that such pressure is put upon me as that I find myself
unable with a good conscience to leave it undone, then Ι will
gladly do my part to secure it, and will help it on as best I can.
In the meantime, I would abide by the two Orders aforesaid3
and publicly among the people aid in the promotion of such
Divine Service‚ besides preaching, as shall exercise the youth
