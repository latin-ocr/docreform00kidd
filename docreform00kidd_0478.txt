450 THE ANABAPTISTS IN lumen, 1525-32 207

Latinae linguae periti sunt. Omnia enim ista Latina peragun-
tur lingua. Proinde ut acl totam quoque ecclesiam, ad ipsum,
inquam, populum promiscuum aliqua redeat utilitas eundem
illum locum, quem hactenus tractarunt sacri interpretes et
prophetae, pro publica concione plebi exponunt episcopi, pro-
ponentes plebi ea quae aedificationis sunt, consolationis et
exhortationis. Interim autem, dum sacra ad hunc modum a
prophetis interpretibus et episcopis tractantur, tota ecclesia
sedet, omnia quae dicuntur diiudicans, id est, tacite apud se
expendens, quo pertineant omnia, quis eorum usus ac fructus.¹

No. 208. The Council’s mandate for Church-
going, 10 Aug. 1531.

Whereas the mandate for Church-going put out last year
[26 March]‚ 1530, has been badly observed, and people‚
young and old, men and women, idly wander about hither and
thither during sermon-time, on the bridges‚ down the alleys,
by the gates and alongside the moats; therefore our Lords
order all persons who have concern and oversight in this
matter of Church-going and particularly, since need requires it,
such as ought always to go from time to time, and hereby
earnestly command that every man shall strictly observe the
mandate to go to Church on Sundays and Holy—days. And
that no man may be able to fraudulently say that he went to
another church, it is provided that henceforth the preachers in
all the three churches shall begin to preach at one and the
same time, convenient to all.

Our Lords further give notice hereby to the numbers of
those who are free and well-off that on work-days they frequent
the prayers and preaching more diligently and better. They
have ordered, and it will henceforth be the rule, that the
morning sermon shall take place every day, as hitherto, and

that at 8 am. sor half-an-hour there shall be a discourse and
prayer.
