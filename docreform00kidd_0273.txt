107 THE DIET OF SPEIER,⁷1529 245

unanimous vote, and in all honour, equity, and right, such a
unani-mous decision can only be altered by a similarly unani*
mous vote. But besides this, in matters which concern God·s
honour and the salvation and eternal life of our souls‚ every
one must stand and give account before God for himself 3 and

no one can excuse himself by the action or decision of another,
whether less or more. ·

CATHOLIC AND PROTESTANT, 1529

The action of the majority at Speier had been rendered possible
through the growing reconciliation of Pope and Emperor which
issued, 29 June, in [No. 108] the Treaty of Barcelona (Dumont,
Corps Difilomalique, IV. ii, No. Ι). Shortly afterwards, 5 August,
the Peace of Cambray (ibid. IV. ii, No. 2) between Charles and
Francis increased the advantage of the Catholic majority. lt
might seem finallyrassured when, 15 October, the Turks raised the
siege of Vienna; for, failing unity among the reformers, the Turk
was the best ally'of the Reformation. Such unity had been
attempted when, just after the Protest at Speier, a ‘particular
secret understanding ' (Ney, op. cll. 270) was concluded‚ 22 April,
between the Elector, the Landgrave, Nurnberg‚ Ulm, and Strass·
burg. It was an understanding between North and South,
between Lutheran princes and towns nearer to the Swiss: and
Philip saw the importance of making it permanent. Accordingly,
on 22 April, the day of its inception, he wrote to Zwingli, 1484e
†1531, inviting him to take part in discussion with the Saxon
divines (Zuz'ngliz' Opera, viii. 288, edd. Schuler <md Sclzultlzesn.
They hesitated ε but the Landgrave at length prexailed both with
Luther (de XX'ette, iii. 473) and with Melanchthon (Corpus Reser-
malornm, i. 1077), and there was held a [No. 109] Colloquy
at Marburg, Michaelmas, 1529. It turned upon the Eucharistic
presence, as appears froin the [Gelasio Redolplzz' Collz‘m' (Zuinglir
Opera, IV. ii. 173 sqq), a professor at Ztirich who accompanied
Zwingli: and issued, 3 October, in the fifteen [No. 110] Articles
of Marburg (ibid. 181 sq), on all of which Saxon and Swiss
agreed except on the fifteenth. Luther then took these articles
and revised thern against ‘the Sacramentarics’ (ibid. 190). So
revised, they became known as the seventeen [No. 111] Articles
of Schwabach (Corpus quormatorum, xxvi. 151 sqq), and took
rank as the first of the Lutheran Symbolical Books. For political
purposes they were accepted by the Elector and George Margrave of
Brandenhurg-Ansbach, at, 16 Oct„ the Convention of Schwabach‚
as the condition of membership in a strictly Lutheran league of
North German states. Ulm and Strassburg sell off: and thus
Philip’s wider combination sailed.
