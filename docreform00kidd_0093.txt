35 THE THREE TREATlsEs OF 1520 65

a priest can never be anything but a priest-—that is, that he
can never become a layman. All this is nothing but mere
talk and ordinance of human invention.

It follows, then, that between laymen and priests, princes and
bishops, or, as they call it, between spiritual and tempora]
persons, the only real difference is one of office and function‚
and not of estate. . . .

. . . Therefore I say, Forasmuch as the temporal power has
been ordained by God for the punishment of the bad and the
protection of the good, we must let it do its duty throughout
the whole Christian body, without respect of persons, whether
it strike popes, bishops, priests, monks, nuns, or whoever
it may be. . . .

Whatever the ecclesiastical law has said in opposition to
this is merely the invention of Romanist arrogance. . . .

Now, I imagine the first paper wall is overthrown, inasmuch
as the temporal power has become a member of the Christian
body, although its work relates to the body, yet does it belong
to the spiritual estate. . . .

The second wall is even more tottering and weak: that they
alone pretend to be considered masters of the ScriptureS. . . . If
the article of our saith is right, ‘ Ι believe in the holy Christian
Church‚’ the Pope cannot alone be right 3 else we must say,
‘I believe in the Pope of Rome‚’ and reduce the Christian
Church to one man, which is a devilish and damnable heresy.
Besides that, we are all priestS, as I have said, and have all one
saith, one Gospel, one Sacrament3 how then should we not
have the power of discerning and judging what is right or
wrong in matters of faith?. . .

The third wall falls of itself, as soon as the first two have
fallen ,- for if the Pope acts contrary to the Scriptures, we are
bound to stand by the Scriptures to punish and to constrain
him, according to Christ’s commandment . . . ‘tell it unto the
Church’ (Matt. xviii. 15-17). . . . If then I am to accuse him
before the Church, I must collect the Church together.. . .
Therefore when need requires, and the Pope is a cause of
offence to Christendom, in these cases whoever can best do SO,
as a faithful member of the whole body, must do what he can
to procure a true free council. This no one can do so well as
the tempora] authorities, especially since they are fellow-
Christians, fellow-priests. . . .
