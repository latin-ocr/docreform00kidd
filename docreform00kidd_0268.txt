No. 103. The Imperial Mandate, 30 Nov. 1528.

Charles‚ by the grace of God, Roman Emperor Elect, ἃς.
Dear Uncle ἂι Prince, &o . . . We will that you, on the
appointed day of the month of February, in your own person. . .
appear . . . together with our . . . Commissioners and other our
Electors‚ Princes, and Estates of the Empire . . . to advise δε
resolve, &o . . . And if you do not appear within ten days
after the day appointed our envoys and Commissioners will,
notwithstanding, discuss and determine affairs with the Estates
then δε there present, in all respects as if you and others who
absented yourselves on slight and frivolous grounds, had been
present. All which we shall attend to and execute with firmness

δε vigour, in the same manner as if all the Estates, whether
present or absent, had agreed to them. . .

To My gracious Lord the Margrave George ¹.

No. 104. The Proposition or Speech from the
Throne, 15 March 1529.

(1) Next‚ your aforesaid Imperial Majesty has no small grief
and trouble that in the German nation‚ during your reign, such
evil, grave, perflous, and pernicious doctrines and errors have
arisen in our holy saith, and are now daily increasing more and
more. Thereby not only (though this is the most important
part of the matter) are the Christian and laudable laws, customs‚
and usages of the Church held in contempt and disgrace, to
the reproach and dishonour of God our Maker ; but also to
that of your Imperial Majesty and the Empire. In particular,
the German nation‚ its estates subjects, and allies are thereby
roused and inflamed to grievous and pitiful revolts,tumu1ts,
war, misery, and bloodshed 3 while your Majesty's edicts and
mandates, together with the 'recesses of the Empioe, are so
little regarded, or rather, in so many ways treated with such
gross opposition and contempt, as that your Majesty is seriously
displeased and in no mind (as indeed becomes the Head of
Christendom) any further to tolerate or permit the same.

(2) Whereas then in the Recess lately made at Regensburg
[28 May 1527] . . . it was held that in the matter of differences
and discords . . . there was no better way open to a fruitful
result than by a General Council or, at least, a> National
Assembly . . .

(3) And whereas now the relations between your Imperial
