194 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 95

great complaint and offence about the different kinds of new
Masses, that every one makes his own, some with a good
intention and others out of conceit to introduce something
new themselves and to make a good show among others and
not be bad masters. As then always happens with Christian
liberty, few use it for anything else than their own pleasure or
profit: and not for God's honour and the good of their neigh-
bour. While, however, every man is bound on his conscience,
in like manner as he uses such liberty himself, not to hinder
nor forbid it to any one else, we must also take care that
liberty be servant to love and to our neighbour. Where, then,
it happens that men are offended or perplexed at such diversity
of use, we are truly bound to put limits to liberty, and, so far
as possible, to endeavour that the people are bettered by what
we do and not offended. Since, then, in these matters of
outward ordinance nothing is laid upon us as matter of
conscience before God, and yet such ordinance can be of use
to our neighbour, xxe ought in love, as St. Paul teaches, to
endeavour to be of one and the same mind 3 and, ‘to the best
of our power, of like ways and fashion 3 just as all Christians
have one baptism and one sacrament, and no one has a special
one given him of God.

Still, I do not wish hereby to demand that those who
already have a good Order or, by God's grace, can make a
better, should let it go, and yield to us. Nor is it my meaning
that the whole of Germany should have to adopt forthwith our
Wittenberg Order. It never was the case that the ministers,
convents, and parishes were alike in everything. But it would
be a grand thing if, in every several lordship, De'vine Service
were conducted in one fashion· and the neighbouring little
townships and villages joined in the cry with one city. Vx hether
in other lordshipst> they should do the same or something
different, should be left free and without penalty. In fine, we
institute this order not for the sake of those who are Christians
already. For they have need of none of these things (for
which things' sake man does not liv:e but they live for the
sake of us who are not yet Christians, that they may make us
Chrisffians), they have their Di'vtne service in their spirits.
But it is necessary to have such an Order for the sake of those
who are to become Christians, or are to grow stronger3 just as
a Christian bas need of baptism, the u ord and the sacrament
not as a Christian (for, as such, he has them already), but as a
sinner. But, above all, the O’rder is for the simple and for
