PREFATORY NOTE

IN 1890 it fell to my lot to lecture, for the Delegates
of Non-Collegiate Students‚ in the Faculty of Theology‚
on the English Reformation. In 1892, Dr. Bright, then
Regius Professor of Ecclesiastical History, honoured me
with a request to lecture for him on the Continental
Reformation. Both these subjects were at that time
recognized as Ordinary Subjects for the Honour School
of Theology. But they were apt to receive unequal
attention. The sources of the English Reformation
were made accessible in 1896 in Gee ἃ Hardy, Docu-
ments illustrative of E nglz'slc Clcmfcla Hz'slmy: but there
was no similar collection available for the study of the
Continental Retormation. In 1897, Ι asked the Board

²...of the Faculty of Theology to consider the preparation
{of such a volume3 and they were good enough not only

 

(nto suggest that I should undertake it, but also to com-
Εἱῐῐιεηὰ the proposal‚ with all the weight of their autho1ity‚
§to the Delegates of the Univcrsity Press. The Delegates
§consentedz and hence this attempt. One of their
{numben Dr. Stubbs, then Bishop of Oxford‚ made the
important suggestion that the collection ‘should include
crlsome Scottish documents’ .
