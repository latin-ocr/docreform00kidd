No. 166. Mandate of the Burgomaster and Council 1
for Scriptural preaching‚ Dec. 1520,

That they all and generally preach in freedom (as is also
granted by the papal laws) the holy Gospels and Epistles of
the Apostles conformably with the word of God, and the true
divine Scriptures of the Old and New Testament‚ and that
they teach that which they receive and hold from the said
Scriptures‚ and say nothing of other accidental innovations and
rules.

No. 167. Bullinger’s2 account of Zwingli's
preaching in 1521.

Zwingli preached at this time very earnestly against taking
money, saying that it would break up and disturb the pious
Consederation. He spoke also against unions with princes
and lords. If they were made, each honest man should
regard them. What had been promised should also be kept.
Therefore, no one should enter into any unions5 and if God
helps a people out of unions, they should avoid entering into
them again3 for they cost much blood. ‘And I wish‚' said
he, Zwingli, ‘that they had made a hole in the union with
the Pope, and had given his messenger something to carry
home on his back.' He said also that one would be aroused
about a voracious wolf, but they do not offer protection from
the wolves which destroy men. They may well wear red
hats and mantles3 for if one should shake them, ducats and
crowns would fall out 3 if one should wring thern, there would
run from them his son's, brother's, father’s, and good friends'
blood.
