he was educated with all the care and respect which could
become the son of the greatest Emperor who ever reigned
in Christendom and the heir of possessions of such vast
magnitude.

Having been brought up after this manner, his Majesty,
when he first quitted Spain, passed through Italy and Germany
to F landers, and conveyed a universal impression that he was
of a severe and intractable disposition, and therefore he was not
much liked by the Italiam, thoroughly disliked by the Flemings,
and hated by the Germans. Consequently hc was first warned
by the Cardinal of Trent, then hy Queen Mary, and even morc
effectually by his father, that a character for severity did not
become the ruler of various nations and people of various
habits and customs. . . .

His efforts are directed not to increase his possessions by
war, but to preserve them by peace 3 for at the commencement
of his reign he made a truce with the king of France, notwith-
standing that the Emperor refused his consent, and that the
Bishop of Arras publicly condemned it. He regulated the
disorders of the ministers of his realms ,ς he restored the courts
of law3 he expedited the grants of favours and the decrees of
justice, which the Emperor was accustomed to delay; he showed
liberality towards all persons, and never permitted any one to
leave his presence dissatislied. But when the Emperor, who
had by his great reputation for prudence and experience main-
tained the authority of his son, departed for Spain, his Majesly
was too weak to support so great a burden, and soon found
himself involved in serious difficulties, which might hare orer-
thrown him had he not been aided by fortune, and the im-
prudence of his enemies. Then, if he had ‹lcsired to imitate
the Emperor, he might have done so by the strength of his
power and the prosperity of his fortune, which arc most
formidable to the world : hut although he resembles his father
in his features, in his mode of speech, in his observance of
religion, and in his kindness and good faith, he is dissimilar in
many other respects which constitute the crowning-point of
the greatness of Princes. The Emperor delighted in all that
pertained to war, but his Majesty has neither knowledge os
warlike matters, nor delight in them. 'l‘hc Emperor undertook
great expeditioris, but thcsc the king avoids. The Emperor
planned great designs, and conducted them with dexterity, and
to his great benerit: hut the king thinks less of incrcasing his
own power, than of obstructing the power of others The
