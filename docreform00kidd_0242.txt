T HE an PET1T10N.

And forgive us our trespasses, as we forgive them that tres-
pass against us.

What does that mean?

Answer. We ask in this prayer that our Father in heaven
may not regard our sin, and may not because of it reject our
prayer, for we are not worthy of anything we ask, neither have
we deserved it, but that He will grant all to us of His grace,
for we sin greatly each day and deserve nothing but punish-
ment. And in our turn we will heartily forgive and do good
to all those who sin against us.

THE SIXTH PETITION.

A nd lead NS not into tenzptcztion.

What does that mean ? ι

Answer. God, it is true, tempts no man, but we ask in
this prayer that He will guard and preserve us, so that the
devil‚ the world, and our flesh may not deceive us nor lead
us into unbelief, doubt, and other great sins and crimes, and
that, though we be tempted therewith‚ we may at length over-
come and be victorious.

THE SEVENTH PETITION.

But delz'ver us from evil.

What does that mean?

Auswer. We ask in this petition, as though to sum up,
that our Father in heaven may deliver us from all evil of
body, soul‚ goods, and honour3 and that, finally, when our
hour has come, He will grant us a blessed end, and in His
mercy take us from this vale of tears to Himself in heaven.

Amen.

What does that mean ?

Auswer. T hat I am to be assured that such prayers are
acceptable to our Father in heaven and are heard by Him, for
He Himself has commanded us so to pray, and bas promised
to hear us. Amen, Amen, that is, Yea, yea ; thus shall it be.
