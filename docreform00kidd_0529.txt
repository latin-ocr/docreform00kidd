 

FAREL IN GENEVA‚ 1532-(1 501

minjard, ii, No. 382, n. 23 and Jeanne de Jussie, 46 sq.) of 9 June.
They were the work of a minority. By decrees of 29—30 June
(Herminjard, ii, No.383, n. 2), by a deputation on 4 July (ibid. No.
382) to Freiburg, and by letter, 12 July (ibid. 383, n. 3) to the Papa]
N uncio [No. 248] the Council disclaimed all sympathy with
‘Lutheranism·: and Farel had to depart the day he arrived,
4 Oct. But, 3 Nov.‚ [No. 249] Antony Fromment appeared in
his stead. He opened a school (A. Fromment, Les Actes et Gestes
merveilleux de la cz‘te‘ de Genbve, 13, ed. G. Revilliod,¹ 1854), and,
1 Jan. 1533, began to preach in the streets (Herminjard, iii, No.
406, n. 1 ; Jeanne de Jussie, 52).

Next day, 2 Jan. 1533, to satissy one ally, Freiburg, the Two
Hundred resolved ‘ quod nemo ab inde audeat in domibus et locis
privatis neque publicis, nisi licentia Dominorum Sindicorum et
Vicarii habita, praedicare' (Herminjard, iii, No. 406, 11. 1). But,
20 March, the other, Bern, complained of the treatment of its
preachers (ibid. No. 411 and n. 4). Geneva thus found itself
between the hammer and the anvil abroad ; and, 28 March, face to
face with riots at horne (Jeanne de Jussie, 53: and 241, n.). 80,
by decree (cf. Actes el Gestes, App„ p. mi) of Passion Sunday.
30 March, [No. 250] the Council sought to temporize (Hermin-
jard‚ iii, No. 414, 11. 9). But party strife continued. On Maundy
Thursday, 10 April, ‘the Lutherans met in a garden to celebrate
their Supper ' (Jeanne de Jussie, 54 ; Herminjard, iii, No. 416, n.
26) : and, in a riot of 4 May, Peter Werly, Canon of St. Peter's and
a native of Freiburg, was slain (Herminjard, iii, No. 416). Taking
up his cause, Freiburg, by letter of 29 May (ibid. No. 421, n. 1),
induced the Bishop to return, 1 July (ibid.) : but he left the city for
good, 14 July (ibid. No. 428, 11. 2); and contented himself with
writing, 25 Sept., to recover his lost jurisdiction (ibid. No. 428)
and with prohibiting‚ 20 Now, false doctrine (ibid. No. 439). It
was soon the turn of the Bernese to take offence at insults which
they alleged to have been directed against them by the Dominican
Guy Furbiti‚ who had arrived, 30 Nov.‚ as Advent preacher (Jeanne
de Jussie, 74). They demanded, 17 Dee, [No. 251] the arrest of
Furbiti (Herminjard, iii, No. 441, and n. 13) which took place on
24 Dec.; and they let Farel return, 20 Dec. (ibid. No. 442, 11. 1);
but, 24 Dec., [No. 252] Freiburg required that Farel‚ in his turn,
should be silenced (ibid. No. 442).

On 1 Jan. 1534 the Vicar intervened with an order ‘de non
legendis Litteris Sacris nec Sacro Dei Evangelio’ (ibid. No. 446,
n. 6) ; Bern thereupon sent, 21 Jan.‚ [No. 253] an ultimatum (ibid.
No. 446), the result of which was, 27 Jan.——3 Feb„ [No. 254] the
First Disputation of Geneva (ibid. No. 453) and, aster further
rioting, [No. 255] the grant of a church to the Reformed (ibid.
n. 1, and p. 4203 and Jeanne de Jussie, 86), 1 March. A rupture
