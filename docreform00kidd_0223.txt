95 LUTHERAN COMMUNrTIEs, 1526—9 19 5

the young folk who must daily be exercised in the Scripture
and God's Word, to the end that they may become conversant
with Scripture and expert in its use, ready and skilful in giving
an answer for their saith, and able in time to teach others and
aid in the advancement of the kingdom of Christ. For the
sake of such, we must read, sing, preach‚ write, and compose 5
and if it could in any wise help or promote their interests,
Ι would have all the bells pealing, and all the organs playing,
and everything making a noise that could. The Popish Divine
Services are to be condemned for this reason that they have
made of them laws, work, and merit ,- and so have depressed
saith. And they do not direct them towards the young and
simple, to practise them thereby in the Scripture and Word of
God; but they are themselves stuck fast in them, and hold
thern as things useful and necessary to salvation : and that is
the devil. For in this wise the ancients have neither ordered
nor imposed them.
Now there are three different kinds of Divine Service.

[1] The first, in Latin; which we published lately, called
the Formula llffc‘ssae. This Ι do not want to have set aside or
changed ; but, as we have hitherto kept it, so should we be
still free to use it where and when we please‚ or as occasion
requires. Ι do not want in anywise to let the Latin tongue
disappear out of Divine Service 3 for Ι am so deeply concerned
for the young. If it lay in my power, and the Greek and
Hebrew tongues were as familiar to us* as the Latin, and
possessed as great a store of fine music and song as the Latin
does, Mass should be held and there should be singing and
reading, on alternate Sundays in all four languages—German,
Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Ι am by no means of one mind
with those who set all their store by one language, and despise
all others ; for I would gladly raise up a generation able to be
of use to Christ in foreign lands and to talk with their people,
so that we might not be like the Waldenses in Bohemia whose
saith is so involved in the toils of their own language that they
can talk intelligibly and plainly with no one unless he first
learn their language. That was not the way of the Holy
Ghost in the beginning. He did not wait till all the world
should come to Jerusalem, and learn 'Hebrew But He en-
dowed the office of the ministry with all manner of tongues,
so that the Apostles could speak to the people wherever they
went. I should prefer to follow this example; and it is right
also that the youth should be practised in many languages.
