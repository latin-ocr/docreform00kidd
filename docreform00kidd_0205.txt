serfdom, as true Christians‚ unless it should be shown us from
the Gospel that we are serfs.

The Fourth Article.-—In the fourth place 11 has been the
custom heretofore that no poor man should be all owed to
touch venison or wild fowl, or fish in flowing water, which
seems to us quite unseemly and unbrotherly‚ as well as selfish
and not agreeable to the word of God. In some places
the authorities preserve the game to our great annoyance
and loss, recklessly permitting the unreasoning animals to
destroy to no purpose our crops, which God suffers to grow
for the use of man, and yet we must remain quiet. This is
neither godly nor neighbourly. For when God created man
, 116 gave him dominion over all the animals, over the birds
of the air and over the fish in the water. Accordingly, it is
our desire if a man holds possession of waters that he should
prove from satisfactory documents that his right has been
wittingly acquired by purchase. We do not wish to take
it from him by force, but his rights should be exercised in
a Christian and brotherly fashion. But whosoever cannot pro-
duce such evidence should surrender his claim with good grace.

The Fifth Article. —In the fifth place we are aggrieved m
the matter of wood· cutting, for the noble folk have appro-
priated all the woods to themselves alone. If a poor man
requires wood he must pay double for it [or‚ perhaps, two
‚ pieces of money} It is our opinion in regard to a wood
ἶ· which has fallen into the hands of a lord, whether spiritual

ξ or temporal‚ that unless it was duly purchased it should revert
‚j again to the community. It should, moreover‚ be free to
every member of the community to help himself to such

 

firewood as he needs in his own home. Also, if a man
requires wood for carpenter⁷s purposes he should have it free,
but with the knowledge of a person appointed by the com-
munity for that purpose. Should‚ however, no such forest
be at the disposal of the community, let that which has been
duly bought be administered in a brotherly and Christian
manner. If the forest, although unfairly appropriated in the
first instance, was later duly sold, let the matter be adjusted 111
a friendly spirit and according to the Scriptures

The Sixth Article —The sixth complaint 15 111 regard to the
excessive services demanded of us, which are increased from
day to day. W e ask that 11115 matter be properly looked into,
so that we shall not continue to be oppressed m this 11 a) and
that some gracious consideration be given 115 since our fore
