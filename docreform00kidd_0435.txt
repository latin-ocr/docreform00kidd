No. 183. Zwingli's resignation and re-appoint-
ment, 12 Nov. 1522.

Burgomaster Roist and Councillors.—Whereas the Provost
and Chapter of the Great Minster on Wednesday after
St. Martin's Day appeared before the Council to say that
Huldreich Zwingli had resigned his office of people’s priest,
for which it lay with them again to provide ,- and that, with
a view to the office being honestly filled by a learned man, they
were desirous of taking counsel with my Lords: and whereas
my Lords have understood from Master Huldreich, both on

and resolved that until next Whitsuntide the said ladies of
either part shall in God's name friendly and lovingly live and
remain together in Christian charity‚ pending some steps to be
taken in the meanwhile, whether by spiritual or by temporal
authority, whereby it may be arranged how and what to do or
not to do.

2. It is further decreed that each lady may at her plcasure
choose and have a confessor, of the secular or of the regular
clergy, to hear her confession at the grill as the custom is.
Moreover both secular and regular clergy shall and may say
Mass and preach in the church 3 and it is cxpi-cssly required that
