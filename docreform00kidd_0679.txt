mort en ceste opinion d'eux qu’ils m'ont plus craint qu'aime‚ et
encores me craignent plus qu'ils ne m'aiment‚ et ont tousjours
eu peur que je ne les troublasse en leur eucharistie. . . .

Calvin wasto prove the only international resonuer3 and. first,
by uniting German with French Switzerland upon the doctrine of
the Sacraments. Zwingli's sacramental doctrine had been mainly
destructive. Of sacraments in general, he taught ‘sacramentum
esse sacrae rei, hoc est factae gratiae signum' (Niemeyer, Call.
Cous. 26) : and, as to the Eucharist, he held that, as at His ascen-
sion, our Lord was ‘adsumptus in coelum, abiit crgo et non est hic'
(ibid. 47). The most he would admit was that ‘verum Christi
corpus adsit fidei contemplatione’ (ibid. 26). Zwingli thus lest
behind him a doctrine which Luther dubbed Sacramentarian and
Calvin called ‘ profane ’. But Bullinger, his son-in-law and successor,
1531-†75‚ at Ziirich was more constructive. In his Uffsolzannscn
[Faber] W yenischen Bisclzcffi Troslbit'clzlel'n trh'ssliclze Vercznlwor-
lung [Zijrich‚ 1532] he abandoned sacramentarianism for Sacra-
mentalism and wrote: ‘ We acknowledge in the Supper a mystery 3
the bread is not mere baker’s bread but honourable, holy, and sacra-
mental bread, wherein Christ is present, to wit, sacramentally‚
spiritually to the eye of saith, since else bodily He sitteth at the
right hand of God, But as the sun standeth in the hcavens and
yet reacheth hither to us with its rays, so Christ sitteth at the right
hand of God, and yet worketh in all faithful hearts' (cf. Hauck-
Herzog, Realencyclopddie ³, iii. 543). Bullinger thus opened the way
sor the reception of the Genevan doctrine of the sacramente in
German Switzerland. Calvim after correspondcnce 1548—9‚ with
