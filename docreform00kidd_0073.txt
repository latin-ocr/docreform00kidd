THE DISPUTATION AT LEIPZIG, 1519 45

a challenge to Carlstadt to hold a public disputation in some
University to be agreed on. The challenge was accepted; and
Luther, meeting with Eck in Augsburg Oct. 1518 (de NVette, i.
216), arranged for the disputation to take place at Leipzig, subject
to the approval of George, Duke of Saxony, of the Albertine line,
1500—†39, and the authorities ecclesiastical and academie.

While the negotiations were pending the combatants began to
arm: Eck, with twelve propositions, Dec. 1518, directed at Carl-
stadt whom he now designated ⁴ Luther’s champion ’; and Luther,
by this time no second, but protagonist, with twelve counter-theses
which he sent to Spalatin 7 Feb. 1519 (de VVette‚ i. 222). Eck
raised his series to thirteen, ‘contra M. Lutherum,' and republished
them 14 March (Loescher, iii. 559 sqq„ and 210 50.). Whereupon
Carlstadt replied, 26 April, with seventeen (ibid. 284 sqq.); and
Luther, raising his also to thirteen, sent thern to John Lange 16 May
(de Wette, i. 274), under the title Disputalz'o et excusatio F. M.
Lutheri adversus criminationes D. Io. Eccii (Lutheri Op. Lat. iii.
12 sqq.; Loescher, iii. 563 sqq. and 212 50.). On [No. 24] the
thirteenth of Eck's and of Luther’s series respectively the vital
issue was joined at Leipzig, and Luther gave a hint of the line
he would take by publishing early in June his Resolutio super
propositione ΧΗ] de potestate Papae (Loescher, iii. 123 sqq.;
Lutherz· Op. Lat. iii. 296 500.; and cf. Beard, Mar-tin Luther,
292 sq.).

Leipzig, founded 1409, was a seat of the Old Learning; but,
though its Chancellor, Prince Adolphus of Anhalt, Bishop of Merse-
burg, 1514—†26‚ supporting the Theological Faculty‚ forbade the
disputation, the University was not indisposed to try conclusions
with its younger rival VVittenberg, founded 1502, and appealed to
Duke George. On 17 June [No. 25] the Duke sent a highly
characteristic letter (Seidemann‚ Die Leipziger Disputation,
App. xi. 119 sqq.) to the Bishop, and fixed the disputation for
27 June. It was held in the Pleissenburg, his castle on the out-
skirts of the town. Besides the accounts left by the principals, Eck
(Loescher, iii. 222 sqq.), and Luther (ibid. 233 sqq.‚ and de Wette,
i. 284 sqq), and by others, we have [No. 26] an account from
the point of view of an independent onlooker, Peter Schade
(Mosellanus‚ 1494“†1 524 3 Loescher‚ iii. 242 sqq), the only humanist
of the University. On 27—ss June Eck debated with Carlstadt Grace
and Free-wi113 and on 4—8 July, with Luther, the primacy of the
Pope. Luther successfully contested the ins divinum of the
Papacy on historical grounds, but was betrayed into a denial of the
infallibility of General Councils as illustrated by the case of Hus,
whereupon Eck seized the advantage thus given him to claim
the victory in argument for himself (the Acta, in Loescher‚ iii.
292 sqq.; Lutherz' Op. Lat. iii. 23 sqq.), as appears from [No. 27⁷1
the minutes of the Disputation.
