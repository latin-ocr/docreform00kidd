MELANCHTHON

Philip Schwarzerd, 16 Feb. 1497-†19 Ap. 1560, was born at
Bretten in the Palatinate‚ and was educated first at Heidelberg,
1509-12, then at Tstbingen, 1512-14, where, as M.A.‚ 25 Jan.
1514, he began to teach. On the recommendation of his great-
uncle, the famous John Reuehlin, 1455-†1522‚ he was made Pro-
fessor of Hebrew and Greek at VVittenberg, 26 Aug. 1518. He
carne thither as a humanist and was always to some extent a
theologian against his will (Beard, Hsbbert LecMcres, 90). Though
never in Holy Orders‚ he took his RD. 19 Sept. 1519, and began
to lend support to Luther by lecturing in theology. A lifelong
relation was thus set up between them ;--ί Ι am rough, boisterouS,
stormy, and altogether warlike’ wrote Luther‚ in a preface to
Melanchthon’s Commentary on Colossians‚ ‘I am born to fight
against innumerable monsters and devils. 1 must remove stumps
and stones, cut away thistles and thorns, and clear the wild
sorests: but Master Philip comes along softly and gently, sowing
and watering with joy, according to the gifts which God has
abundantly bestowed upon him.’ ln Dec. 1521 Luther’s main ideas
found classical expression in Melanchthon’s [No. 47] Loci Com·
munes ( Corpus Reformatorum‚ xxi. 82 sqq. ι edd. Bretschneider and
Bindseil, Brunsvigae, 1834—60), which had its origin in lectures
on the Epistle to the Romans. ‘ In its earliest form it was a col-
lection of Heads or Loci——topics for . . . oral amplification from
the Professor at his desk' (Beard, op. cit. 286): but it became,
as enlarged in successive editions, 1521-59, the systematic ex—
position os Lutheran theology’ (ibid. 903 cf. 287). Some of its
earliest positions underwent important modifications, for which
