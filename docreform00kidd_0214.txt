186 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE

28 Jan. 1524 (Tschackert, No. 176, ii. 49) which Luther contrasts
with a pronouncement from the other side by the neighbouring
prelate in Western (or Polish) Prussia, Maurice Bishop of Ermland
1523-†37 (Lutheri Op. Lat. vii. 66 sqq), and then wrote of its
author 1 Feb. ‘Sed et episcopus tandem unus Christo nomen dedit
et evangelizat in Prussia, nempe Sambiensis, quem fovet et erudit
Io. Brismannus quem illuc misimus abiecto cucullo ut et Prussia
regno Satanae valedicere incipiat' (de VVette, ii. 474). A year
later Erhard von Queiss, nominated (Tschackert, No. 134, ii. 35),
but never confirmed, Bishop of Pomesania‚ 1523-†29, put out his
[No. 92] Programme of Reforms, 1 Jan. 1525 (Tschackert, ii. 101,
No. 300). The prelates were aided by the preachers, who arrived in
Konigsberg 1523—4 (ibim, Nos. 141, 237), Jo. Briessmann 1488—
†1550, and Paul Speratus, 1484-†1551. Prussia thus acquired its
new religion and its new political status together, as was observed
in [No. 93] a letter of Andrew Bishop of Premysl, 1524—7, to
the Nuncio in Hungary (Acta Yomz'cz'ana, vii. 249). On 30 May
1525 the Bishop of Samland (Tschackert, ii. 120, No. 356), ancl
23 Oct. 1527 the Bishop of Pomesania (ibid. ii. 194, No. 565)
each gave up his temporal lordship. They retained their spiritual
jurisdiction-—administered now, as before, by officials —till, 1550,
Superintendents were substituted for Bishops because they were
cheaper (ibid. i. 113; iii. 263, No. 2374). On 6Ju1y 1525 the Duke
issued his mandate for evangelical preaching (ibid. ii.‚126, No. 371).
This was followed up, 10 Dec„ by thirteen articles of the Diet (ibid. ii.
142, No. 417), and by an episcopal order, based on the fourth of
these, for Ceremom'es and other Clmrclz Order (Richter, K z'rclzen-
ordnungen, i. 283 cf. Tschackert‚ i. 129). It was published March
1526 (ibid. i. 129 and ii. 142, No. 418), being modelled, in part,
on Luther²s Formnla Missae. These reforms were enforced by
a Visitation (ibid. i. 133, ii. 157, Nos. 459, 460) 31 March; and in
[No. 94] the ducal (ibid. i. 168, n. 1, ii. 235, No. 699) and episcopal
(ibim, No. 700) prefaces to the Synodal Constitutions of Jan. 1530,
Speratus, now ‘bishop’ of Pomesania, set out the theory of the
authority by which they had been carried through (cf. Richter,
Gesclziclzfe der ev. K irclzenvmyassung, 36). On 29 Sept. 1526, the
Duke had been received into the League of Torgau (Tschackert‚
ii. 17 , No. 1 ).

ΙΙ.5 111 Ε1566510121 Saxony Luther²s first ideal, as we have seen
(supra, 121 sqq.), had been to leave each community free (de Wette,
ii. 563) ; and this freedom he used to put out his [No. 95]
German Mass and Order of Divine Service (Sehling, op. cit. I. i.
10 sqq.) first sung in XVittenberg 29 Oct. 1525 (de Wette, iii. 36) and
published Jan. 1526. But after the Peasants’ War he began to look,
for ecclesiastical discipline, to regulation by the State, 30 Nov. 1525
(ibid. iii. 39, 51). 011 22 Nov. 1526, since ‘papal and episcopal
discipline was gone’ (ibid. iii. 136), he begged the Elector to take
matters in hand. Four commissioners were accordingly appointed,
13 Feb. 1527. and provided, 16 June, with Instructions (Sehling,
