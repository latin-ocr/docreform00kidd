200 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 95

and the Spirit himself speaks not through the preacher <though
I set no limits to the preacher ,- for the Spirit can teach better
than any Postills or Homili'es) the end of it will be that every
man will preach what he likes3 and, instead of the Gospel
and its exposition, they will be preaching once more about
blue ducks! There are further reasons why we keep the
Epistles and Gospels as they are arranged in the Postills‚
because there are but few inspired preachers who can handle
a whole Gospel or other book with force and profit.

[i] After the sermon shall follow a public paraphrase of the
Lord's Prayer, with an exhortation to those who are minded to
come to the Sacrament, in this, or some other better, fashion,
as follows: ‘ Dear friends in Christ, as we are here gathered
together, in the name of the Lord, to receive His holy Testa-
ment, Ι exhort you, first, to lift your hearts to God and to say
with me ‘Our Father' according as Christ our Lord hath
taught us, faithfully promising that we shall be heard: [‘ Our
Father,’ διο, in paraphrasel. Next, Ι exhort you in Christ
that with right saith ye take heed to the Testament of Christ:
and specially that ye hold fast in your hearts the Word whereby
Christ gives us His body and blood for remission of sins3
that ye bethink you of, and thank Him for, the 'infinite love
which He has shown us in that through His blood He has
redeemed us from God's wrath‚ from sin, death, and hell z and
then take to yourselves outwardly the bread and wine, which
is His body and blood, for an assurance and pledge thereos.
In such wise will we, in His name and as He commanded
in His own Word, handle and use His Testament.’ Whether
this paraphrase and exhortation should take place in the
pulpit, immediately after the sermon, or at the altar, I leave
free to every man's discretiori. . . .

[k] Then the Office and Consecration proceeds, as follows :
‘ Our Lord Jesus Christ, in the same night' (1 Cor. xi. 23 ff).
I think that it would be in accordance with the Last Supper
if the sacrament were distributed immediately after the con-
secration of the bread before the blessing of the cup. So say
both Luke and Paul: ‘Likewise also the cup after supper.'
Meanwhile, there might be sung the Sanctus in German or the
hymn ‘Gott sei gelobet', or the hymn of John Huss, ‘Jesus
Christus unser Heiland.' And after this should come the
consecration of the chalice and its delivery, with the singing of
whatever remains of the above-mentioned hymns, or of the
Agnus Dec· in German.
