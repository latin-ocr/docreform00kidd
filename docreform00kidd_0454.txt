426 THE DISPUTATIoNs AT Z'URICH‚ 1523 194

upon certain articles, &o : and whereas the Burgomaster and
Council appointed three of their number to act with the
commissaries of the Provost and Chapter aforesaid: Now
therefore, by the common consent of both sides, Articles are
resolved as follows 2—-

1. First, inasmuch as divers troubles have arisen by reason
of the clergy making overcharge, in the matter of tithes, sees,
and burdens, whereof the ordinary man complains, the Provost
and Chapter hereby agree to surrender all their church-dues at
the Great Minster‚ viz. the burdens which the ordinary man
has hitherto had to pay. F urther, they agree that, at the Great
Minster‚ no one shall be required to pay sor baptism, for the
administration of the sacraments, for spiritual advice, or for
a grave—space, without a gravestone: though, if any one wishes
to have a gravestone, he must pay for it. No one is to be
required to set up candles at a funeral, though if any one
wishes to stick them up, he must be at charges for them.
And if any one wishes to have the bells tolled for the departed
in the Minster only, then he need not pay: but, if in the
Minster and in other churches as well, then he must pay the
see as hitherto.

4. Further, it is thought good that the number of priests
and clergy be reduced, so far as can be done with a good
conscience, until no more persons remain than suffice for the
preaching of God’s Word and other Christian purposes.
Those who are now occupied as Canons ¹ and Prebendaries¹
may remain, and die in peace. But no one is to be appointed
in their place, till a number is reached to be determined by
both sides : and their prebends are to be devoted to Christian
and useful purposes hereafter to be determined.

5. Further. ..it is resolved that well-learned, able, and
honest men be appointed to give public lectures day by day
in Holy Scripture‚ for an hour in the Hebrew, an hour in the
Greek, and an hour in the Latin tongue, as is necessary for the
right understanding of divine Scripture. . . .

6. Further‚ provision should be made for an honourable,
learned, and discreet priesthood‚ to the honour of God and of
our City and Country‚ and for the salvation of souls, at the
House of God known as SS. Felix and Regula: and likewise
steps should be taken, according to need, to find right, true,
and capable nien in God’s Word and the Christian life, to set
over our pious subjects as pastors‚ parish-‚ and people's-priests.

¹ The Minster had ‚⁸4 Canons and over 50 l'rebcndaries or Chaplains.—
