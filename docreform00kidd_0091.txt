35 THE THREE TREATISES OF 1520 63

No. 35. To the Christian Nobility of the
German Nation.

The Romanists have, with great adroitness, drawn three
walls round themselves, with which they have hitherto pro-
tected themselves, so that no one could reform them, whereby
all Christendom has fallen terribly.

First‚ if pressed by the temporal power, they have affirmed
and maintained that the temporal power has no jurisdiction
over them, but, on the contrary, that the spiritual power is

Secondly, if it were proposed to admonish them with the
Scriptures, they objected that no one may interpret the
Scriptures but the Pope.

Thirdly, if they are threatened with a council, they pretend

Now may God help us, and give us one 'of those trumpets

Christian rods for the 'chastisement of sin, and expose the
craft and deceit of the devil‚ so that we may amend ourselves
by punishment and again obtain God's favour.

Let us, in the first place, attack the first wall.

It has been devised that the Pope, bishops, priests, and
monks are called the spiritual estate, princes, lords, artificers,
and peasants‚ are the tempora] estate. This is an artful lie
and hypocritical device, but let no one be made afraid by it,
and that for this reason: that all Christians are truly of the
spiritual estate, and there is no difference among them, save of
office alone. As St. Paul says (Ι Cor. xii), we are all one body,
though each member does its own work, to serve the others.
This is because we have one baptism, one Gospel, one saith,
and are all Christians alike 3 for baptism, Gospel, and saith,
these alone make spiritual and Christian people.

As for the unction by a pope or a bishop, tonsure, ordination,
consecration, and clothes differing from those of laymen—all
this may make a hypocrite or an anointed puppet, but never
a Christian or a spiritual man. Thus we are all consecrated
as priests by baptism, as St. Peter says: ‘Ye are a royal
priesthood‚ a holy nation (1 Pet. ii. 9), and in the book of
Revelation : ‘and hast made us unto our God (by Thy blood)
kings and priests’ (Rev. v. 10). For, if we had not a higher
