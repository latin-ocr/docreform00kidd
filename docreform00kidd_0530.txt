502 FAREL IN GENEVA, 1532—6

ensued with Freiburg, which withdrew from its alliance with Geneva,
14 May (Herminjard, iii, No. 449, n. 3), and turned to the Bishop.
Allying himself, 23 June (ibid. No. 473, n. 8), with the Duke of
Savoy, on 30 July [No. 256] the Bishop attacked the city (ibid.
No. 474) ; and thus, though [No. 257] the Reformed were still in a
minority (ibid. No. 479) and the Bishop was not yet repudiated, on
1 Oct. it was declared that, ‘le Siege de 13 Justice episcopale de
ceste cite, et en ycelle, a vacque' et vaeque 3 present ⁹ (ibid. No. 481,
n. 5); for he had removed it to GeX‚ and all was in train for the
breach next year.

By the opening of 1535 the par-ishes of the city, through the
demolstion, 23 Aug. 1534, of two suburbs with their churches of St.
Victor and St. Leger in defence against Duke and Bishop, had been
reduced to five—St. Pierre (the Cathedral), Notre—Dame 13 Neuve
(l’Auditoire), 13 Madeleine‚ St. Ger-main, and St. Gervais: though
the five convents remained as yet-——the Franciscam, the Nuns of
St. Clare, the BenedictineS, the Dominicans, and the Augustinians
(ibid. No. 522, nn. 6, 7). A frontal attack soon followed on the Ro-
nianist majority3 for at, 23 April, [No. 258] the request of the
Warden of the Franciscan convent (Mdmoires et Documents de
la Socic‘te' d’Hislm're et d’Arclze'alogie de Genbve, xxii. 209 ; Jeanne
de Jussie, 118) where, since 2 April, Farel and Viret had been
lodged, and by, 26 May, [No. 259] decree of the Two Hundred
(Herminjard, iii, No. 509, n. 9: MAmoz‘res, &c., 210) there took
place, 30 May—24 June, [No. 260] the Second Disputation of
Geneva (Chrom’que de Rosci, iii. 35, ap. llst'moires, ἃς, 208 sq.). By
default ofthe party in office, Farel and Viret, sor the minority, carried
the day and [No. 261] Farel proceeded to complete his victory.
On 23 July he seized the church of St. Mary Magdalen (flldmoires,
&c., 213); on 8 Aug. he preached at the Cathedral, and image-
breaking became general (Jeanne de Jussie, 150, 263 sq.); on 10
Aug. 116 went to the Council and in a ‘ great speech ' (Me-‘moires‚ &c.‚
213), the drift of which appears to be preserved in his account of the
Disputation (ibid. 239), demanded and obtained, 10 and 13 Aug„
[No. 262] the provisional abolition of the Mass (ibid. 213 sqq.).
On the loth inventories os Convent goods were ordered (ibid. 215),
preparatory to the dispersal of the Religions3 and, 12 Aug„ [No.
263] Religious and Seculars were summoned to accept the
situation (ibid. 215). But they preferred to leave the city (cf.
Fromment, Actes et Gesta, c. xxxvii) most of them before, 29 Aug„
[11102264] t)he departure of the Nuns of St. Clare (Jeanne de

115516, 207 .
J Events would have moved quicker but for the danger frorn Bishop
and Duke. At last, 10 Aug, [No. 265] Geneva reported its de·
solate condition to Bern (qurminjard, iii, No. 522). For a time
Rern could do little. But she was suddenly set free to act by,
1 Now, the death of Francesco Ssorza, Duke of Milan, and the con-
sequent revival by Francis I of his somewhat fanciful claims on the
Duchy. These brought Francis into collision (winter of 1535-6)
