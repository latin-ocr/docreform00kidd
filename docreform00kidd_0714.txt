THE OVERTHROW OF THE ANCIENT CHURCH,

1560

Scotland, politically connected with the Continent by a traditional ,ἵ

alliance with France, was the one part of the British Isles where
Calvinism, imported from the Continent, won a complete triumph.

Nowhere else were [No. 334] the corruptions of the Church so 3

deep-seated‚ and so freely admitted by her best friends, e. g. by
Ninian Winzet 1518—†92 (certain Tractatz's, i. 4'sqq., published

 

by the Scottish Text Society, 1887—8: and, for similar evidence, -.·
Joseph Robertson, Statum Eccl. Scot. ii. 290, n. 206): and while ξ ’
this explains her hopeless overthrow and the hatred with which ‘¹
the Calvinists eliminated every vestige of the ancient order, it goes :⁴-

some way towards justifying the new discipline which they set up.

 

The beginnings of reform, however, are'to be connected with the ⁴3 Ἰ
propagation os Lutheran opinions by Patrick Hamilton,¹ 1504—†28‚ ι
a young layman with noble and even royal blood in his veins, who, ,

aster studying at Marburg, 1527, began to preach near Linlithgow
till, though ‘a heretic with the power of the Hamiltons at his back ’,

he was seized by James Beaton‚ Archbishop of St. Andrews 1522- 1
†39, and burnt there 27 Feb. 1528. Meanwhile, it had been ,

necessary, '17 July 1 52 5, to [No 335] prohibit Lutherarl books by

seaports. The archbishop continued his policy of repression; but ·

⁶ the reek of Patrick Hamilton insected all on whom it did blow ' ;
and when he was succeeded by his able but dissolute² nephew,
Dax 1d Beaton, 1494-r1546, who became Cardinal 1538, Primate
1539 and Legate 1543, an extreme typ e of reforming opinion came
to the fore in George Wishart³ 1513—†46.Vi1shart sought safety
