by the General Assembly‚ 1564, and completed the ecclesiastical
reconstruction. ln the First Book of Discipline, it is cited as
‘the Order of Geneva’ (Dunlop, ii. 520), and was used, 1556, by
Knox's congregation there (Knox, Works, iv. 141 sqq), though
the first drast of it was made for the English congregation ,’
31 Frankfort, on the basis of Farel’s and Calvin’s services as
modified by the thmgia §acm [23 Feb. 1551] of PoHanus, the
successor of Calvin at Strassburg. Commonly known as Knox’s ¹
thm gy, it is in part a guide or model like its originals, and the .
minister was free at points to substitute for its zpszmsszma verba
others‘ like in effect' (Dunlop, ii. 417). It embodied the rule of ἱ

Thus the new system was alike continental' 111 origin and revolu-
tionary in design. Its authors were men who regarded themselves
as committed ‘to that same warre’ against the ancient church
‘ which God commanded Israel to execute against the Canaanites. '
