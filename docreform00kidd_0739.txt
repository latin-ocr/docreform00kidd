CHAP. X. THE MANNER or THE ADMiNis'rRA'MON or·
THE LORD'S SUPPER.

T lae day wlaen tlze Lord‘s Supper ὼ· ml'm'slered, zerlescla z's
commonly used once a mouth, ον so oft as llze Congregall'on shall
llzink expedient, llce zllz‘nc'ster usella lo say as follows :—

LET us mark, dear brethren, and consider how Jesus Christ
did ordain unto us His holy Suppes, according as St. Paul
maketh rehearsal in the eleventh chapter of the First Epistle
to the Corinthians, saying, “I have received of the Lord that
which Ι have delivered unto you, to wit, That the Lord Jesus,
the same night that He was betrayed, took bread 3 and when
He had given thanks‚ He brake it, saying, Take ye, eat ye3
this is my body, Which is broken for you z do ye this in remem-
brance of Me. Likewise after Supper, He took the cup, saying,
This cup is the N ew Testament, or Covenant, in my blood 3 do
ye this, so oft as ye shall drink thereos, in remembrance of
Me: For as oft as ye shall eat this bread, and drink of this
cup, ye shall declare the Lord's death until His coming.
Therefore, whosoever shall eat this bread, and drink of the
cup of the Lord, unworthily‚ he shall be guilty of the body and
blood of the Lord. Then see that every man prove and try
himself, and so let him eat of this bread, and drink of this cup ;
for whosoever eateth or drinketh unworffiily, he eateth and
drinketh his own damnation‚ sor not having dne reg-ard and
consideration of the Lord's body.'⁷
