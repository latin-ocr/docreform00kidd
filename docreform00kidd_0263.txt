Word of God.

(3) All bishops shall furuish the King with a schedule of
their rents and income of every kind. From these schedules
he shall determine the relative proportions for them to keep
' and to hand over to the Crown.

(4) A similar course shall be pursued with regard to the
cathedrals and Chapters.

(5) Auricular confession must be given up as already com-

fines imposed.

(6) An account must also be rendered to the King of all
