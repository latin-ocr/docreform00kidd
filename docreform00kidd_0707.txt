No. 330. The Report of the Venetian Ambassador
in France, 1561.

Unless it otherwise pleases the Almighty, religious affairs
will soon be in an evil case in France, because there is not
one single province uncontaminated. Indeed in some pro-
vinces, such as Normandy, almost the whole of Brittany‚
Touraine‚ Poitou, Gascony, and a great part of Languedoc,
of Dauphiny, and of Provence, comprising three-fourths of the
kingdom, congregations and meetings, which they call as-
semblies‚ are held 3 and in these assemblies they read and
preach, according to the rites and usages of Geneva, without
any respect either for the ministers of the king or the com-
mandments of the king himself. This contagion has pene-
trated so deeply that it affects every class of persons, and, what
appears more strange, even the ecclesiastica] body itself. I do
not mean only priests, friars, and nuns, for there are but few
monasteries that are not corrupted, but even bishops and
many of the principal prelates, who hitherto had not shown
any such dispositi0113 and it is only on account of the rigorous
execution of the law that other persons besides the populace
have not disclosed themselves, because they have restrained
themselves for the time being, from sear of the loss of their
property and lives. But your Serenity¹ must learn that while
the people and the populace show fervent devotion by fre-
quenting the churches and observing the Catholic rites, all
other classes are supposed to be disaffectcd, and the nobility
perhaps more than any other class, and, particularly, persons
of forty years of age and underff' If these disafsected indi-
viduals continue to attend Mass and the Divine (mices, and
externally to practise Catholic rites, they do so for show and
from sear ς because when they either are, or believe themselves
to be, unobserved, they avoid and even fly from the Mass·
above all things, and also from the churches as far as they are
able, and more so since it became known that by imprison-
ment, chastisement, and burnings, no remedy was found. It
has now been determined not to proceed against any disaffected
