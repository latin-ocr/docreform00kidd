468 CAPPEL, 1529-31

Theological agreement was now to be the basis of political co-
operation. Other cities joined: in 1528, Bern 25 June (Bullinger,
ii, ξ 240) and St. Gall 26 Nov. (ibid. ξ 249), and in 1529 Biel, 28
Jan. and Miihlhausen 17 Feb. (ibid. ξ 261), Basel 3 March (ibid.
ξ 268 1, Schaffhausen, 15 Oct. (ibid. ξ 325). The Five Forest Cantons
replied, 22 April, by the Christian Union with Ferdinand of Austria
(ibid. ξ 264, and cf. Ranke, Ref. 642). A collision was inevitable.

of, 26 March, the Abbot's death (ibid. § 276), 1110 Council of zurich,
28 Jan.‚ took advantage of its turn as protector of the Abbey,
to seize its property, secularize it, and introduce ‘the Gospel'
(Strickler, Aktensammlzmg, ii, No. 46). Not content with this act
of aggression which he had supported (ibid. No. 48), on 30 May
[No. 221] Zwingli wrote to Bern (Opera, viii. 294) 10 stiffen its
resolution for war3 and, when there broke out the First War of
Cappel (Bullinger‚ ii, ξ 298),11 was he who drafted both, 8 June, the
reasons for the declaration of war (ibid. ξ 297) and, 11 June, the
proposals (Opera, viii. 296) which ended, 25 June, in [No. 222]
the First Peace of Cappel (Bullinger, ii, ξ 314). 011 30 June in
[No. 223] a letter to Conrad Sam at Ulm (Opera, viii. 310), he
rightly claims the Peace as a victory for his side.

But events in Germany were threatening. On 7 April 1529 the
Diet of Speier resolved (supra, No. 105) to extend no toleration to
Sacramentaries: and the dominance of the Emperor, following
upon his reconciliation with the Pope by, 29 June, the Peace of
Barcelona (supra, No. 108) and with Francis Ι by, ’5 August, the
Peace of Cambray, gave reason for alarm. Scarcely had the
protest, 19 April, appeared (supra, No. 107), when, 22 April [No.
224], Philip of Hesse wrote to Zwingli (Opem, viii. 287) proposing
a conference with a view to united action. Zwingli accepted the
invitation, 7 May (ibid. viii. 662) ; but only to find that theological

2 Nov., to concert with Philip and Venice (ibid. 665), and even,
18 Jan. 1530, with France (ibid. 397), a wider league. The accession
of Strassburg, 5 Jan. 1530, to the Civic Alliance (ibid. 393) was the
only result. But, as Butzer wrote, 23 June, from Augsburg (ibid.
473), such was the animosity os Lutherans to Oberlanders at the
Diet of Augsburg, 20 June—22 Sept. 1530 (supra, Nos. 115—23), and
such the antipathy of Zwingli (Opem, viii. 549) to Butzer's Eucharistic
doctrine that two Confessions, besides that of Augsburg (supra, No.
116), had to be offered separately to the Emperor: on 8 July [No.
225] Zwingli’s Fidei Ratio (Opera, iv. 1 sqq. and Niemeyer,
collectio Confessionum‚ 16 sqq.) and on 11 July [No. 226] the Con-
fessio Tetrapolitana (N iemeyer, 740 sqq.) in which Bntzer set forth
the position, intermediate theologically as geographically between
Saxon and Swiss, of Strassburg. Constance, Memmingen, and
Lindau.
