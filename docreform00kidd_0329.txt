124 PROTESTANTS IN ARMS 301

Politz‘sche Correspondenz der Slaa's Strasshurg, ii. 17 sqq.). Its im-
portance lay less in the number of its adherents than in their differ-
ences of rank, belief, and geographical situation. Princes combined
with cities‚ Lutheran with Zwinglian‚ north with south, in desence
of a common cause. The combination was aided by the death of
Zwingli, 11 Oct. 1531, which set Upper Germany free for alliance
with Lower. In December, at Frankfurt, the League received
a constitution, with the Elector and the Landgrave as its chiefs : in
April 1532, at Schweinfurt‚ a completed organization. Germany
had now ‘another centre besides the diets ’ (Ranke Res. 675), and
the League soon became an imperinm in imperio.

Whereas it is altogether likely that those who have the pure
Word of God preached in their territory, and thereby have
abolished many abuses, are to be prevented by force from
continuing this service so pleasing to God 3

And whereas it is the duty of every Christian government
not only to have the Word of God preached to its subjects
but alsQ as far as possible, to prevent their being compelled
to fall away from it 3

Now we, solely for the sake of our own defence and de-
liverance, which both by human and divine right is permitted
to every one, have agreed that whenever any one of us is
attacked on account of the Word of God and the doctrine
of the Gospel, or anything connected therewith, all the others
shall immediately come to his assistance, as best they can,
and help to deliver him. . . .
