176 THE WEAKENING OF THE 83

whomsoever the community may appoint, shall gather and
receive this tithe. From this he shall give to the pastor,
elected by the whole community‚ a decent and sufficient main-
tenance for him and his, according to the judgment of the
whole community. What remains over shall be given to the
poor of the place, as the circumstances and the general opinion
demand. Should anything farther remain, let it be kept, lest
any one should have to leave the country from poverty. Pro-
vision should also be made from this surplus to avoid laying
any land tax on the poor. In1 case one or more villages thern-
selves have sold their tithes on account of want, and the village
has taken action as a whole, the buyer should not suffer loss,
but we will that some proper agreement be reached with him
for the repayment of the sum by the village with due interest.
But those who have tithes which they have not purchased from
a village, but which were appropriated by their ancestors, should
not, and ought not, to be paid anything farther by the village,
which shall apply its tithes to the support of the pastors elected
as above indicated, or to solace the poor, as is taught by the
Scriptures. The small tithes, whether ecclesiastical or lay, we
will not pay at all, sor the Lord God created cattle for the free
use of man. We will not, therefore, pay farther an unseemly
tithe which is of man's invention.

The Third Article.—It has been the custom hitherto for
men to hold us as their own property, which is pitiable enough,
considering that Christ has delivered and redeemed us all,
without exception, by the shedding of his precious blood, the
lowly as well as the great. Accordingly, it is consistent with
Scripture that we should be free and wish to be so. Not that
we would wish to be absolutely free and under no authority.
God does not teach us that we should lead a disorderly life in
the lusts of the flesh, but that we should love the Lord our
God and our neighbour. We would gladly observe all this as
God has commanded us in the celebration of the Communion.²
He has not commanded us not to obey the authorities, but
rather that we should be humble, not only towards those in
authority, but towards every one. We are thus ready to yield
obedience according to God’s law to our elected and regular
authorities in all proper things becoming to a Christian. We,
therefore, take it for granted that you will release us from
