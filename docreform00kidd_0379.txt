action. With the aid of Gropper and another Erasmian, Konrad
von Heresbach (ibid. 72), the adviser of John ΙΙΙ, Duke of Jijlich-
Cleve, 1521-†39, the Archbishop had already taken steps at the
Provincial CouncilofK61n‚ March 1536, to effect a reform of abuses,

MDXXXVI, ξ ΙΙ, cap. xxii [Parisiis‚ 1550]). But in the winter
of 1542-3 he began to show an inclination to Lutheranism, and
called to his aid at Bonn first Butzer (Varrentrapp, op. cit. ii. 54),
and then Melanchthon (C. R. v. 19). Here Butzer drew up the
liturgical, and Melanchthon contributed the doctrinan, part of
a scheme of reform based on Andreas Osiander's‚ 1498—†1552‚
Church Order for Brandenburg-Niirnberg (Richter, K ircltenord-
nungen, i. 176 sqq.). It was published 1544 as Hermann’s Bedenken
(ibid. ii. 30 sqq.) and 1545 in Latin as his Deliberalio: but is best
known to Englishmen as Hermann’s Consultation, 1547—8, for its
influence on the Book of C ammon Prayer (cf. Dowden, Tlte W'ork-
mansln'p of tlte prayer Book, c. ii). Melanchthon's account of
[No. 142] Hermann's attempted reformation is preserved in his
letters (C. R. v. 112 sq„ 148 sq.) from Bonn. When submitted
to the Diet there, July 1543, the proposals were welcomed by the
lay estates (Varrentrapp, 207) τ and the Archbishop had previously
received promise of support (ibid. ii. 83) from William V, Duke of
Cleve, 1539—†92, who at Easter 1543 declared himself Lutheran
by receiving the Sacrament in both kinds. But he was stoutly
resisted by his Chapter, who, 1 Oct. 1543, presented their criticisms
in Gropper's Antz'dzdagma, published 1544. This again is of
interest to Englishmen, sor ‘there can be little doubt that both the
phraseology and the sequence of ideas in the canon os the Mass of
1549 were markedly influenced by the Chapters on the Mass
(ed. 1544, foll. xlii sqq.) in that book ’ (Rev. F. E. Brightmam in
lee Cum-dian of 22 May 1901).

Gropper’s criticisms put an end to the Archbishop's Lutheranizing
programme ; for they synchronized with the Emperor’s victory over
the Duke of Cleve, and the terms which he imposed on him,
7 Sept. 1543, by the [No. 143] Treaty of Venlo (Dumont, Corps
dzplomatique, IV. ii. 265). Charles thus put down what, for him,
were specially dangerous movements on the borders of his hereditary
dominions in the Low Countries. But the threatened defection of
one of the three spiritual Electors, coupled with the fact that the
Elector Palatine‚ Frederick 11, 1544—†56, was already wavering,
while his nephew and heir, Otto Heinrich, Elector 1556—†9‚ had
already gone, alarmed the Emperor. Defection such as this would
have meant that the Protestants were about to gain a majority in
the Electoral College‚ and that the Empire would be lost to the
House of Hapsburg. Charles hastily concluded with Francis,
18 Sept. 1544, the [No. 144] Peace of Crespy (Dumont‚ IV. ii.
279 sqq.): and, abandoning Conferences for a Council, began to
think, at the same time, osan appeal to the sword.
