25 THE DISPUTATION AT LEIPZIG, 1519 47

of as idle and profligate persons. We quite believe that if this
disputation brought thern a good feast and a fair sum for little
trouble, then they would consider it a praiseworthy exercise,
and by no means to be refused. But as their leisure would be
disturbed, your Grace and everybody else must give in, so that
they may have their own way. They are like bad soldiers.
If they hear a single shot‚ they think they have been hit.
Dr. Eck has not announced in his writing what he wishes to
dispute about. They are afraid he wants to dispute about
matters which they would not know how to propound, and
consequently they wish to divine and judge before they have
heard plaintiff or defendant . . .

That our theologians should shun such disputations seems
to us to be contrary to their profession 3 for to thern, as teachers
of the Scripture, it ought to be a joy to bring to light that over
which they have eaten many good dinners, inasmuch as they
have the highest places in lectureships and feasts. But if they
know it, and do it not, or will not bring it to the day, I would
just as soon have a year-old child in their place3 for it is to be
hoped that we might in time bring it to do what we wanted
and to let us hear what it knew, and we would in the mean
time keep it on pap and simple food ! Let your Grace consider
what your shepherd thinks of his dogs when they will not bark
and will not bite the wolf. If they cannot stand these dis-
putations‚ and are afraid of being worsted‚ then we would
rather have old women in their places to sing to us and spin
for us for pay l

This then is our friendly request, that your Grace would not
consent to the above who call themselves theologians and yet
are ashamed to bring their knowledge to light3 but that you
would urge them with all your might to allow the disputation
to take place, unless it is openly forbidden by His Holiness. . .
