THE WEAKENING OF THE REFORMATION,
1524—5

The progress of reform, beyond the Empire or within, had
Sssar‘felffi begun when, by the events of 1524—5, it was seriously
c ec<e :—

1. By the secession of the Humanists a breach had for 501116
time been imminent, as appears from [No. 80] letters of Luther to
Oecolampadius 20 June 1523 (de Wette‚ ii. 352) and of Erasmus
to Zwingli 31 Aug. (Zuz'nglz'i Opera, VII. i. 308, ed. SchiiIer and
Schultess, 1830). A request from Henry VIII caused Erasmus to
open it with a treatise, which he commended to the King in
a [No. 81] letter of 6 Sept. 1524 (ep. 702, Erasmz' Opera, Tom. ΙΙΙ,
Pars i, col. 816, ed. Lugd. Bat. 1703), entitled [No. 82] De Libero
Arbitrio (Op. ix, col. 1215 sqq.). Luther’s reply, delayed by the
Peasants’ XVar, appeared in the De Servo Arbitrio (Op. Lat. vii.
113 sqq.) of Dec. 1525, and he re-affirmed its unqualified deter—
11111115111 as late as 1537 (de XVette, v. 70).

ΙΙ. By the Peasants’ War (see Ranke, Refi 334 sqq.,ed. Johnson),
social discontent of long standing, gathering fresh impetus from
the religious teaching of such exiles from Saxony as Carlstadt
in Franconia and T. Miinzer in Swabia and Thuringia, broke out
first on 24 Aug. 1524 at Waldshut in the Black Forest. By the
winter of 1524-5 the peasants were masters of Upper Ger-
many, claiming freedom for ‘all whom God Almighty had made
free in Christ his Son '. They put out the less radical of their
demands, March 1525, 111 [No. 83] the Twelve Articles (text
in Bohmer, Urlemzden sur Gescln'clzte des Banernkmqgres. [Lietz-
mann, Klez'ue 111113, Nos. 50, 51] Bonn,19103 cf. Translalz'ons and
Reprinls from the Orzjgimzl &Mares (ff European Hz'slory, vol. ΙΙ,
No. vi. 25 sqq, philadelphia, Pa.) : and Luther‚ after vain
attempts at mediation, 19 April, when it was already too late, in
his Ermahumlg sum Frsedeu anselle Xll A rtikel der Bauernsclzafl
2⁴12 Sele-waben (Walch, xvi. 58 sqq), threw himself, in May, on to the
side of the temporal rulers with a violent pamphlet, entitled,
Widm· die nn'irderisclzen und ramesia-clem Rollen der Bauern
(Walch, xvi. 90 sqq.) They took him at his word 3 and the reform-
ing princes, John Elector of Saxony‚ 1525-†32, and Philip Land-
grave of Hesse, 1518-167, united with the Catholic Dukes George
of Saxony, 1500—†39, and Henry of Brunswick, 1514—†68, to
crush the peasants at Frankenhausen, 15 May 1525. But it was
both for the temporal sovereigns and for the Pope ‘ a victory over
the Lutherans' ; resulting in ‘the divorce os the Reformation from
popular sympathies, and its delivery into the hands of the Princes ³
(Beard, Hz'bbert Lectum, 200).

III. By the death of 1116 Elector Frederick, 5 May 1525.

IV. By Luther's marriage, 13 June 1525, to Catherine von Bora,
an apostate nun. To his friends, as in [No. 84] Melanchthon's
