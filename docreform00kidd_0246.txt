218 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 97

slzed sor you for tlte forgiveness of sins ,· tlzz's do ye, as ost as
ye drink it, in remembrance of Me. ,

What avails it to eat and drink thus?

Answer. This is shown us by the words, ‘ Gz‘ven for you
and slzed for you for tlze remissiora of sins.² That is to say,
that in the Sacrament forgiveness of sins, life, and salvation
are bestowed on us by these words. For where forgiveness
of sins is, there is also life and salvation.

How can bodily eating and drinking accomplish these great
things ?

Anszerer. Eating and drinking do not indeed accomplish
this, but the words which stand there, ⁴ Gz'ven for you and
slzed for yon for tlze remission ossius? These words, together
with the bodily eating and drinking, are the most important part
of this Sacrament, and whoever believes these words, he has
what they say, and as they speak, namely‚ remission of sins.

Who, then, are they who receive this Sacrament worthily?

Answer. F asting and bodily preparation are in truth a good
external discipline, but he is truly worthy and prepared who
believes the words, ‘Gz‘ven for you and slzed for tlze remz'ssz‘on
of sins) But he who does not believe thern is unworthy and
not prepared. For the words, ‘forycmss demand truly believing
hearts.
