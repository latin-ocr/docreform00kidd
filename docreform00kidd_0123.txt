48 RADICALISM AT WITTENBERG, 1521-2 95

a synod of the Augustinians of Meissen and Thuringia, Dec. (Op.

Lat. vi. 213 sq.; C. R. i. 456 sqq.), Carlstadt, in spite of the
Elector’s monition against hasty innovation, 19 Dec. (C. R. i. 508),
gave notice of (ibid. 512) and, on Christmas Day, carried into
effect [No. 50] alterations in the Mass (Zez'lung aus PVz'ttenbe73gr‚
ap. Strobel, Aliscellaneen, v. 121), such as he considered would
reduce it to the Scriptural model. Two days later [No. 51] the
arrival of ‘ prophets’ from Zwickau (C. R. i. 513), who both
claimed to be above Scripture in virtue of an immediate inspiration
and rejected infant baptism (ibid. 536 sq.)‚ drew down upon
Melanchthon [No. 52] a reproof from Luther‚ 13 Jan. 1522 (de
Wette‚ ii. 124 sqq.)‚ and added to [No. 53] the confusion (Letter
of Beyer, 25 Jan. C. R. i. 540 : and Froschel’s Preface to his Tractat
vom Priestertlmm, 1565, tr. Gieseler, v, 380), till, 6 March, Luther
himself arrived in Wittenberg (de Wette‚ ii, 141), ancl in a series
of eight [No. 54] sermons, 9—16 March, saved the credit of the
Reformation (ibid. ii. 177) by evoking order out of chaos (Luther's
Schriften, ed. Walch‚ xx 1 sqq. and 62 sqq). In the following Sept.
he provided his countrymen with the touchstone of authority by the
. publication of his [No. 55] translation of the New Testament :

though the real touchstone was not Scripture but leis doctrine of
justification by Faith.

No. 48. correspondence between Luther and
Albert of Mainz.

(a) Lutlzer to tlze Elector, 1 Dec. 1521.—Your Electoral
Grace has again set up the idol at Halle, which ruins poor
simple Christians in wealth and soul. . . . Your Electoral
Grace, perhaps, thinks that I am removed from your way, that
you will now be safe from me3 and that you will easily
crush the monk by means of the Emperor's Majesty. . ..
Your Electoral Grace will remember the beginning, how
great a fire has risen from the little despised spark, when
all the world was so secure and thought that one poor
Mendicant was immeasurably too small for the Pope, and was
undertaking iinpossibilities. But God has taken up the cause.
He has given the Pope with all his followers enough to do.
Against and above the thoughts of the world He has carried
the garnero a point from which the Pope will hardly bring it
down again. It will grow worse with him daily‚ so that the
work of God may be clearly recognized. The same God lives
still: no man can doubt it now. He has power to withstand
a Cardinal os Mainz, though four Emperors were to stand by
him. He has also special pleasure in breaking the lofty cedars 3
and abasing the proud hardened Pharaohs. . . .

But let not your Electoral Grace think that Luther is dead.
