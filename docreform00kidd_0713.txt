from the spiritual jurisdiction of Cologne and Rheims, and to
erect in them three archbishoprics and some bishoprics, which
gives very great satisfaction here, it being hoped by means of
these bishoprics to suppress heresy, which is but too rife.
His Majesty will have the nomination of these archbishoprics
and bishoprics, with the exception of Cambrai, Mechlin, and
Antwerp.

(b) From a note of the Venetian Α mbassador, 6 Marcia 1561.—
In the Provinces of Flanders the archbishoprics and bishoprics
are about to be erected, and King Philip has already nominated
certain persons to many of these, and by this time, at Rome,
the confirmation will have been made, which it was endeavoured
to pass as secretly as possible, lest it be thwarted by the Arch-
bishops of Cologne, Tr'eves, and Rheims, and by the Bishop of
Liege and others who are thus deprived of their respective
jurisdictions.

It was intended to attach to each bishop three Doctors of
Divinity‚ by whose counsel the bishops were to provide for all
matters concerning religion, to which the Flemings object,
lest each bishop should become a tribunal of the Inquisition :
and Ι am assured that in the Council of the Governess one of
its chief members said boldly that they had never in the time
of the Emperor tolerated the Inquisition in those Provinces,
and that they would now still less endure its introduction in
this way.

du Magistrat pour punir les mechants, et maintenir les gens

veiller sur la police, mais aussi de maintenir le sacre ministere‚
pour oter et ruiner toute idolatrie et faux service de Dieu 3 pour
