No. 117. The reprffsfntations of the Legate‚
u y 1530.

Most Invincible‚ Imperial, and Catholic Majesty l Although
I arn sure that it is unnecessary for me to state my opinion to
your Catholic Majesty in the reply to be given to the propo-
sition made by certain illustrious princes regarding the matters
of the saith and our holy religion, seeing that by your singular
wisdom and by your exceptional judgement, in addition to the
faithful and excellent counsels of many of the illustrious Prince-
Electors and other Princes and Lords, you can without me
supply what is needed, yet, at your Highness' command, at
the wish also of the aforesaid illustrious Princes, and since it
is, moreover, not incompatible with my duty through the office
1 hold, I will with all respect say what I think, subject, however,
to the correction of Your Majesty and of any other who holds
a better and sounder opinion.

In the first place, I say that in order to facilitate this business

' it will be very much to the point if your Catholic Majesty with

your very great authority, and then with the help of such
Catholic Princes as shall seem best to you, should with every
care try and strive to bring into the right and Catholic road
some of these Princes‚ even if you cannot bring all who have
subscribed to these articles and propositions 3 and also some of
the imperial Cities‚ which indeed, as your Serene Highness will
see in the reply which will be given to you, being desirous of
persevering in the assertion of the said articles proposed, have

’ἑ strayed far and entirely from the truth and the sincere saith

 

¹ of Christ.
