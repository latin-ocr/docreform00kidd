208 THE ORGANIZATlON OF THE 97

and the common people‚ that they may be quiet, faithful,
obedient, peacefu13 and thou must always adduce many
examples from the Bible of how God punished or blessed
such people.

Especially urge authorities and parents that they govern-
well and send the children to school, and admonish them how
it is their duty to do this, and what an accursed sin they
commit if they neglect it. For thereby they overthrow and
desolate both God’s kingdom and the world's, as the worst
enemies both of God and man. Lay also great stress on the
horrible injury they do, if they do not help to train children for
pastors, preachers, clerks, &c.‚ and that God will punish them
terribly. For it is very necessary to preach on this subject.
Parents and magistrates now sin in this matter more than
we can say. The devil has also most evil designs therein.

finally, because the tyranny of the Pope is past, they
will no longer come to the Sacrament, and despise it.
Accordingly it is necessary to urge them, but with this
caution: we must not force any one to belief or to the
Sacrament, nor make any law prescribing time or place,
but we ought to preach so that they corne ,without our laws
and, as it were, force us, their pastors, to give them the
Sacrament. This we may do by saying to them, ‘Whoever
does not seek or desire the Sacrament, or demand it, at
least once or four times a year, it is to be feared that he
despises the Sacrament and is no Christian, just as he is no
Christian who does not believe in or listen to the Gospe13
for Christ did not say, “Omit or despise this‚’' but “leis do
as oft as γε drink it,” &cs He will surely have it done, and
on no account neglected or despised. ‘ leis d0‚' He says.

But if there be any one who does not greatly prize the
Sacrament, that is a sign that he has no sin, no flesh, no
devil, no world, no death, no danger, no hell, that is, he
believes in none, though he is head over ears therein and
is doubly the devil’s. On the other hand, he needs no
mercy, life, paradise, kingdom of heaven, Christ, God, or
anything that is good. For if he believed that he had so
much evil and needed so much good, he would not neglect
the Sacrament, in which so much help is given against evil,
and so much good is bestowed. We should not then need to
drive him to the Sacrament by any law, but he would come run-
ning and hurrying thither of his own accord, constrain himself,
and urge you, that you should give him the Sacrament.
