et officialibus nec non et archidiaconis et decanis ruralibus
aliisque ad quos criminum denunciatio correctioque quo-

(haeresibus radicitus extirpatis) suum locum recuperet, id
vix alio medio aptius . . . fieri possit quam synodis. Itaque,
priscum synodorum morem renovare cupientes, statuimus et
ordinamus ut singulo anno saltem Synodus Diocesana op-
portuno tempore a singulis episcopis celebretur . . . in quibus
per quartas designentur iudices qui diligenter intendant si
statuta praedicta aliaque per synodos de scitu episcopi sta-
tuenda observentur, invocato ad hoc, si opus fuerit, brachio
saeculari. . . .

THE BEGINNINGS OF REFORM IN SWEDEN,
1523—4

On St. Margaret’s Day, 20 July 1397, by the Union of Calmar,
Margaret, Queen of Norway, united the three Scandinavian
Kingdoms under one elective crown. Half a century later the
Union was in abeyance, and Sweden obtained a King of its own
in Charles Canuteson‚ 1448—57. When, in 1454, he attempted to
restrict the liberty of bequests to the church and attacked the
property and privileges of the clergy, they protested and secured
his expulsion. On 19 June 1457, Christian 1, first King of Den-
mark, 1448-†81, of the House of Oldenburg‚ was crowned King of
Sweden. Next year, he obtained the succession in all three
kingdoms sor his son John : and in 1460 the cluchies of Schleswig-
Holstein came to his House. King John, 1497-1501, could not
hold his own against the nobles : but his son Christian 11, who, in
1513, succeeded his father as King in Denmark and Norway,
landed in Sweden in the character of a papal champion‚ and was
crowned at Stockholm, 4 Nox'. 1520, by Gustavus Trolle, Arch-
bishop os Upsala ¹, 1514-23, a friend of the foreign and of the
