134 THE MISSION OF CAMPEGGIO, 1523—4 68

Ratisbon, he organized a Papal party within the nation pledged to
a plan of conservative reform (Goldasti Const. Imp. iii. 487 sqq),
such as afterwards, though too late for the maintenance of German
unity‚ took place at Trent.

No. 68. ⁴ The entry of Campeggio into Niirnberg,
16 March, 1524.

(1) From a letter of Frz'ar paolo Zz'am', dated 29· March.

We arrived at Nuremberg on the Wednesday in Passion Week.
In these parts the sincere saith of Christ is utterly cancelled3
no respect is paid either to the Virgin Mary or the saints.
On the contrary, it is said that those who employ their aid sin
mortally. They deride the Papal rites, and 6311 1116 relies ot
the saints bones of those who have been hanged. In Lent
they eat meat openly, saying they do not consider it prohibited.
Confession is neglected, as they say it should be made to God,
and that auricular confession is a buffoonery. They generally
communicate under both forms. They make a laughing-stock
of the Pope and cardinals, and other ambassadorial 6661651351165,
by means of paintings and other caricatures. In short, they ’
consider Martin their illuminator, and that until now they
have been in darkness, and the indulgences are held by them
like bread sold in the maritet-place. In proof of all this, the
legate, to avoid scorn, did not enter Nuremberg as Legate ecl
moris est, neither did he give the blessing and absolution, but
came in like a mere horseman, though he was accompanied by
a most noble escort of all the Princes and part of the nobility,
who (with the exception of the Duke of Saxony and Palatine>
are sincere Christians. Some of the noblemen and the mass
of merchants are all tainted‚ nay, obstinate and unconvertible,
so that at present neither the Legate’s authority nor the will of
the Princes . . . can stem so strong a current.

Martin is not at Nuremberg, nor will 116 make his appearance
there ; but, unless the Almighty stretch forth his arm, it will
doubtless come to pass that as the Princes and part of the
nobility remain staunch Catholics, whilst the people persist in
their errors, they will some day cut each other to pieces. The
Legate will remain at Nuremberg until October, perhaps to
hold another Diet in Germany, cum diem dietam subinvocat3
but in this matter Diets profit little, because the free towns are
really not subject to any one, so that they cannot be curbed,
and they are the abettors of Lutheranism, especially Nuremberg
and Augsburg, the asylums of all converts. In the other towns
