55 RADICALISM AT WITTENBERG, 1521-2 105

Annas, Pilate, and Herod had the doing of it <Walch‚ xiv.

(ἐ) Preface to tlze Exposition os 1 Peter, 1523 :—Those
apostles who treat oftenest and highest of how saith in Christ
alone justifies, are the best Evangelists. Therefore are
St. Paul's Epistles more a Gospel than Matthew, Mark, and
Luke. For these do not set down rnuch more than the story
of the works and miracles of Christ 3 but the grace which we
receive through Christ, no one so boldly extols as St. Paul,
especially in his letter to the Romans (Walch, ix. 626).

(c) Preface lo tlze New Damnem, 1524.-John’s Gospel‚
St. Paul's Episffles, especially that to the Romans, and
St. Peter's First Epistle are the right kernel and marrow of all
books. . . for in then] thou findest written down not many
works and miracles of Christ, but in a quite masterly way
expounded how saith in Christ overcomes sin and death and
hell, and gives life, righteousness, and peace. Which is, as thou
hast heard, the right kind of Gospel. . . . Therefore is St. James'
Epistle‚ in comparison with these, a mere letter of straw3 for
it has nothing evangelical about it (Walch, xiv. 104 sq.).

‘hadr no sympathy either with the New Learning or the New
Theology’ (Creighton, Hislmy qs the Papacy, vi. 223 sq„ ed.
1897); but he was genuinely ‘desirous of disciplinary reform ¹.

‘to prove to the Germans the willingness of the Pope to remedy

’ abuses which could no longer be defended' (Creightom vi. 252).
