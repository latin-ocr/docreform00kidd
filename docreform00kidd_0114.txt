86 THE DIET OF WORMS, 27 JAN.—25 MAY, 1521 43

lished at Constance and other Councils, it is my privilege to
uphold. A single monk, led astray by private judgement, has
set himself against the saith held by all Christians for a thousand
years and more, and impudently concludes that all Christians
up till now have erred. Ι have therefore resolved to stake
upon this cause all my dominions, my friends, my body and
my blood, my life and soul. For myself and you, sprung
from the holy German nation, appointed by peculiar privilege
defenders of the saith, it would be a grievous disgrace, an
eternal stain upon ourselves and our posterity, if, in this our
day, not only heresy, but its very suspicion, were due to our
neglect. After Luthers stiff-necked reply in my presence
yesterday‚ I now repent that I have so long delayed pro-
ceedings against him and his false doctrines. Ι have now
resolved never again, under any circumstances, to hear him.
Under protection os his safe-conduct he shall be escorted
home, but forbidden to preach and to seduce men with his
evil doctrines and incite them to rebellion. I warn you to
give witness to your opinion as good Christians and in accor—
dance with your vows.

ut eosdem habeant amicos, eosdem hostes sine exceptione, ut
una atque eadem amborum sit fortuna, idem velle et nolle ad
offensionem quorumcunque et defensionem a quibuscunque
opus fuerit . . . ut qui alterutrum laeserit aut laedere atten-
taverit, alterius continuo sit hostis.. . .

XVI. Item, quoniam S. D N. cura est aliquanto etiam maior
lerum spiritualium et pastoralis officii quam temporalium,
dignitatem Sanctae Apostolicae Sedis supra omnia carissimam
habet, multi autem exorti sunt qui et de Fide Catholica male
sentire et dictam Sedem sua malignitate et maledicentia
lacerare non dubitant, promittit Serenissimus Caesar se contra
eos qui Sedem Apostolicam verbo et facto laedere praesumunt
aut Fidem Catholicam perturbare conantur, ut iustissimum et
Christianissimum Imperatorem decet, omnem vim suae pote
