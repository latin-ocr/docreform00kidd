198 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 95

many there who are to learn to preach in the districts where
the old apportionment of Epistle and Gospel still goes on and
will probably continue. As, then, we can be of use to such
and help them thereby‚ in our judgement, we suffer the custom
to continue3 without, however, finding fault with those who
adopt the books of the Gospels as a whole. Hereby we
provide that the layman has preaching and teaching enough:
but, if a man wants more, he may find it on other days.

[2] Thus on Monday and Tuesday mornings there
should “be a lesson in German on the Ten Commandments‚
the Creed and the Lord's Prayer, on Baptism and the Sacra-
ment3 so that on these two days the Catechism may be kept
up and grasped in its proper sense. On W ednesday morning
a lesson in German, for which is appointed the Gospel of
St. Matthew. The day is to be kept specially for this Gospel :
for Matthew is a fine evangelist to teach the people by, and he
relates Christ’s good Sermon on the Mount‚ and makes much
of the practice of love and good works. But the evangelist
John, who teaches faith with special force, should also have
nis own day—Saturday asternoon at Vespers. And so we
have two Evangelists in daily use. On Thursday and Friday
mornings there are the daily lessons week by week of the
Apostolic Epistles and the rest of the New Testament. This
makes sufficient provision for lessons and preaching, to set the
Word of God going, except it be for lectures in the Universities
to the learned.

[3] We come now to practising boys at school in the
Bible. Every week-day, before the lesson, let them sing some
psalms in Latin, as has been customary hitherto at Mattins3
for, as we have said, we wish the young to be trained and
practised in the Latin tongue, through the Bible. After the
psalms, the boys two or three in turn, according to its length,
should read a chapter in Latin out of the New T estament.
Then let another boy read the same chapter in German for
practice, and in case any layman were there to hear. After
that, go on, with an antiphon, to the lesson in German of
which we have spoken above. Then let the whole lot sing a
German hymn, followed by the Lord's Prayer said silently3
and let the parson or chaplain say a Collect and conclude with
the Benedicamus Domino, as usual. In the same way at
Vespers, let them sing the Vesper Psalms as sung hitherto,
in Latin, with an antiphon3 then a hymn, as there is oppor-
tunity. Then let them read, two or three, by turn, in Latin,
