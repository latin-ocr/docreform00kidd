082 THE DUTCH REFORMEQ 1559-62

Calvinists, who now felt the pressure of the Edicts in common with
Lutherans‚ Sacramentaries‚ and Anabaptists against whom they were
originally directed, sought to disarm the hostility of the govern-
ment by presenting their [No. 333] Confession de Foi des
Eglises Reformees Wallonnes et Flamandes, 1561 (Schaff,
Creeds af Ewmg. Prot. Churches, 383 sqq.) or Confessio Belgica
(Niemeyer, 360 sqq.) in which the Anabaptists were specially repudi-
ated. Originally drawn up in French by Guido de Bres, 1522—†67‚
a WValloon minister, on the basis of the Confessio Gallicana, it was
sent, in 1562, to Philip for authorization, as the belief of a hundred

thousand of his subjects who ‘ were never found in arms or plotting ,¹

against their sovereign ⁵. It made no impression on Philip, but it
was at once taken into use by the Netherlanders in place of the
formularies which they had borrowed from the &Valloon congrega-

tion in London‚ 1550, and their Superintendent John Laski, 1499- '¹

fession was adopted, May 1566, in synod at Antwerp (Brandt,

Hl'slmy osshe husos-malim ἡ] the Low C assumes, i. 142) Calvinistic

principles won the day. It was supplemented by the adoption at

the Synod of Emden, 4-14 Oct. 1571 (Richter, Kirclcenordnangen,

ii. 339 sqq.) of a polity on the Genevan model as best suited for

‘churches under the cross ' and of the Heidelberg Catechism‚ 1574 ⁴

 

(Brandt, i. 311). In 1577, by ⁶ certain Canons drawn up and pub· *0

lished in the name of the Prince of Orange as Stadtholder and of *fl

the States of Holland and Zeeland and their Consederates ' (q. v. in
flaui. 318 sqq.)‚ Calvinism made terms with the State.

ssy this time the whole people had been roused against the
tyranny of Spain. The seven northern provinces—Hollancl, Zee-
land, Utrecht, Gelderland, Overysseh Friesland‚ and Groningen-
withdrew in 1579, and eventually won their independence, 1609, as
the United Netherlands. They were Calvinist to a man. The
remaining ten were reduced to obediencc by Alexander Farnese,
1546—†92, Duke of Parma, in a war, 1578292, which was conducted
‘with full consciousness and fixed design as a war of religion ’. In
every town as it was conquered the Jesuits were settled: and
they ‘transformed Belgium, which had previously been half-
protestant‚ into one of the most decidedly [Roman] Catholic
countries in the world⁷ (Ranke, l'ofies, i. 475).
