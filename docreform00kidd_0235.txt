97 LUTHERAN COMMUNITIES, 1526—9 207

as thou canst. But with the young keep always to one form,
and teach them first of all these articles, namely‚ the Ten
Commandments‚ the Belief, the Lord⁷s Prayer‚ διο, according
to the text, word for word, so that they may repeat them and
leam them by heart.

But as for those who will not learn, let thern be told that
they deny Christ and are no Christians, and let them not be
admitted to the Sacrament, be sponsors to any child, or enjoy
any of the liberty of Christians, but be handed over simply to
the Pope and his Officers, yea, to the devil himself. Resides
this, let their parents or masters refuse them food and drink‚
and tell them that the prince will have such rude people driven
from the land.

For though we cannot and may not force any to believe, yet
we must train and urge the multitude so that they may know
what is right and wrong among those with whom they have
their dwelling‚ food, and life. For whoever would dwell in a
town must know and keep the law of which he would enjoy
the privileges, whether he believe it, or be a rogue and good-
for-nothing in his heart.

Saondly, when they know the text well, teach them next
to understand it, so that they know what it means, and
take once more the method of these rables, this or some
other short method, whichever thou wilt, and keep to it, and
do not alter one syllable, just as we said of the text, and take
time and leisure over it. For it is not necessary to expound all
at once, but one thing after the other. When they understand
the First Commandment well, then take the Second, and so
on, else they will be overwhelmed and retain none.

lez'rdly‚ now when thou hast taught them this short Cate-
chism, then take the larger Catechism, and give thern a deeper
and fuller explanation. Explain every commandment, petition‚
and article, with its various works and uses, its dangers and
abuses, as thou wilt find them in abundance in the many
little books written about them. And especially dwell on
that commandment that is most neglected among thy people.
For example, the Seventhl Commandment‚ about stealing,
must be vehemently urged among artisans‚ tradesmen‚ and
also among peasants and servants, for among such people
there is all manner of unfaithfulness and thieving. Again, the
Fourth Commandment must be specially urged upon children

¹ i. e., the Eighth,as we number them; and so the Fourth, presently men-
tioned, is our fifth.
