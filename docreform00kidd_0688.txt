660 THE HUGUENOTS‚ 1560

In F rance the first signs of reform appeared in quarters in·
fluenced by Humanism, with Jacques Lefevre d’Etaples, 1455-
11536 (snpra, pp. 477, 545: cf. Lavisse, Histoire de France, V. i.
342 sqq.). He and his friends enjoyed the favour of Francis I and
his sister Margaret. But they had powerful enemies; both at
Court, and in the Sorbonne and the Parliament of Paris (ibid.
353 sqq), the two institutions by which, under the Crown, the
unity of France was sustained. With Francis, this unity (expressed
not indeed by the maxim Cuius regio eius relzgz'o, but by its equi-
valent, Unefhi, une lai, un Rei) was the first consideration. Re-
pression‚ therefore, was inevitable. But it took place at intervals—
1523 (ibid. 356 sqq), 1534 (ibid. 374 sqq. ; and supra, No. 270) and
1544-7 (ibid. 386 50.; and ii. 121 sqq.)—and did not prevent
negotiation with the Lutherans abroad. Indeed, the aims of
Francis were at best political, to cement an alliance against the
Emperor. But on his death, 31 March 1547, the prospect of reform
in France taking shape under Lutheran influences disappeared.

He was succeeded by his son, the dissolute yet orthodox (ibid. ii.
201) Henry Ι1,.154.7-·159; and ‘Lutheranism' ‚by a Calvinistie

by, 8 Oct. 1547, the ‘Chambre Ardente’ (Weiss, La Chambre
Ανιίεηίε, Paris 1889), which pronounced 500 sentences between
Dec. 1547 and Jan. 1550; by the edict of 19 Nov. 1549 (Recueil
general des ancz‘emzes lois franfaz'ses, xiii. 134 500., edd. Jourdan‚
Decrusy and Isambert), which submitted cases of heresy, accom-
panied by public scandal, to the civil courts; by 27 June 1551
[No. 323] the Edict of Chateaubriand (ibid. 189 sqq.; Calv.
Ep. 1535, Opera, xiv. [= C. lx'. xlii] 186) which made their
sentence fina13 and, aster the sailure of attempts, 1555-7, to intro-
duce the Inquisition, by 24 July 1557 [No. 324] the Edict of
compiegne (Recuez'l, xiii. 494 sqq.) which left the judges no option
of inflicting any penalty save that of death.

The cruelties that followed only served, under the inspiration of
Calvin‚ to stiffen the resistance, swell the numbers, and perfect the
organization of the Reformed. Thus Dec. 1552 [No. 325] Calvin
wrote to encourage the ‘Five Scholars’ (Ep. 1679; Opera,
xiV. [= C. R. xlii] 423) who perished at Lyons, 16 May 1553. 111
Sept. 1555 [No. 326] the first minister was chosen and the first
congregation organized at Paris (de Beze, Hz'st. eccl. des Eglises
refirmdesde France, i. 98, Anvers, 1580). Other places followed
suit, till there were seventy·two congregations by 1559 (cf. K.
Muller‚ Calvia und die A tgfcinge der sranzh'sz'sclten Hugenotten-
lcimlze, in Premsz'sclaeJnlzrbztclzer, cxiv : Dec. 1903) 3 and ministers
were either asked or sent from Geneva‚ to the number of 19 in
1559, 12 in 1560, and 90 in 1561 (Opem, xxi. [= C. Rxlix] 71-710).
On 26 May 1559 there met in Paris [No. 327] the first National
Synod (de Beze, i. 172). It adopted (a) for its formulary of saith
[No. 328] the Confession de Foi (ibid. 173 500.; opera, ix.
