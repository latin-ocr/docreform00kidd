POLITICs IN GENEVA, To THE ARRIVAL OF
FAREL, 4 OCT. 1532

Geneva ², at the end of the thirteenth century, was under the three-
fold government of the Prince-Bishop, its lord (Dominus), a vassal
of the Empire3 his Vidomne (Vice-dominus) or deputy in things
tempora13 and its burghers (cf. H. D. Foster, ‘Geneva, before
Calvin’ in The American Historical Review for Jan. 1903: vol.
viii. 217 sqq.). But it was surrounded by the territories of Savoy.
Count Amadeus V, 1285-†1323‚ uniting, 1 Oct. 1285, with the
burghers to maintain ‘villam vestram necnon bona et iura vestra
et franchesias vestras, cum rebus omnibus vestris ’- (Spon‚ Histoire
de δεκὲυε, 111, No. xxiii. 109, 6(1. 1730), forced the Bishop, 19 Sept.
1290, to bestow the office of Vidornne upon his house (ibid. No.
xxiv) ; and Savoy controlled it till 1525.

At the end of the fourteenth century it was the turn of the
burghers to win from the Bishop : and the Charter of 23 May 1387
{Oechsli, Quellenbuclz, 11, No. 109), in confirmation of their ancient
franchises‚ gave them four Syndics of their own election‚ ξ 23, and
placed the eriminal processes of laymen in their hands, ξ 8.

111 1116 first half of the fifteenth century Savoy resumed its career
of encroachment. For in 1401 Amadeus VIII bought up the
rights of the last Count of Geneva (Spon‚ i. 163) ; and after
hemming, by grant of the Emperor Sigismund 1410-†37, Duke of
Savoy 1416—34, he figured for a time, 1439-49, as Pope FelixV and ’
secured the bishopric of Geneva, 1444-†5 1, before his death. In the
second half, the Burghers consolidated their power. Possessed
already in 1409 of a Great Council for elective, and of a Little
Council‚ later of 25 members, for administrative purposes, they
acquired, in 1457, 6 third Council (later) of Sixty for diplomatic
affairs. From 1459 11115 was appointed by the Little Council. An
oligarchy was thus gaining strength at the seat of the Bishopric
