117 THE DIET OF AUGSBURG, 1530 293

then enter into a labyrinth from which you could never emerge
any more, and so they would have gained their will : which is,
by such means, to spin the matter out so that the Diet which,
owing to the very great expense, cannot last very long, may
come to an end with the matter still not settled. But let your
catholic Majesty with your illustrious Princes and good and
true Christians, after having established a complete under-
standing and confederation‚ prepare to decide thoroughly to
extirpate these heresies‚ proceeding against thern with order
and system by means of reason and justice, using you your tem-
poral arms and I the spiritual, and thus zealously punish them
as is right3 which, with the help of God, will be easy for yon.
And in this glorious, holy, and very truly Catholic undertaking,
your Serene Highness would show yourself to all the world to
be as in name so in deeds, as I told you before, the true and
undoubted successor of that Charles the Great amongst whose
other greatest undertakings there still resounds thc farne of thc
conquest he made of the Saxons, whereby was then established
the holy and Catholic Christian Faith. And Your Serenity
may be sure that, this enterprise having been dispatched‚
if you wish shortly to take the field—as, I think, you will
wish it because you ought to wish it on account of the very
high position and office you hold—an ample, quick, and broad
way will be made to victories against the Turk, and against
all such as may wish or presume to oppose your holy and
virtuous works.

As for the abuses and disorders, once the affair of the Faith
is settled as was said above, it will then be the right time for
Your Majesty to try and contrive that all should return to the
true path and way, and become true and Catholic Christians,
in which I also, as long as my strength lasts, promise not to
fail as to the duty of my office and the place Ι hold. Nothing
else occurs to me but once more to submit all I have said to
the most wise counsel and judgement ofyour Majcsty, to whom
Ι humbly commend myself.

Your humble servant,
CAR. CAMPEGIUS LEoA'rcs.
