alleged to have said ‘that among a hundred or a thousand
spiritual persons, priests, monks, nuns, brethren, sisters and

the same do worse, as he had come to know through the con-
fessional at Einsiede1n3 and that Beguines or sisters carry
love-letters about with them and are procuresses.’ It would
be worth a good deal if such things did not happen.

ZWINGLI THE HL'MANIST, TO 1519

Huldreich Zwingli was born, 1 Jan. 1484, at Wildhaus, in the
Toggenburg, of peasant but well-to-do parents. His father was
mayor and his uncle the parish priest. The latter became dean
of Vt'esen, 1487—†1513, on the Walensee, and took his nephew with
him to begin his education. Then he sent him to school, first to
Basel, 1494-83 and next, to Bern, 1498-1500‚ with Heinrich
Wolfiin (Lupulus, †1534), a humanist, and, later, a reformer of
that city. Thence Zwingli was removed to the University of
