the saith ; this had been the custom previously, therefore such
[persons under instruction] were called catechumens. You
promised to bring this out in your Exposition of the Articles,
as you did in the XVIIIth Article, on Confirmation. Any
one who reads it will find therein your opinion clearly expressed.
Sebastian Ruckensperger of St. Gall, then prior of Sion at
Klingnau, was present. So you have also confessed in your
book upon the unruly spirits, that those who baptized infants
could quote no clear word in Scripture ordering thern to

the pledge of faith until death in hope of the resurrection to
the life to come, is more to be considered than the sign. This
meaning has nothing to do with babes ,- therefore infant baptism

stead, as Christ for us. I believe, yea, Ι know, that it will not
go well with Christendom until Baptism and the Supper are
brought back to their own original purity. Here, brother, you

infants; he does not appear to have ever reached the point of becoming an
