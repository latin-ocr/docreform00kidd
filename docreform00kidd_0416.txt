388 THE BEGINNINGS OF THE

De delectu et libero ciborum esu (Opera, i. 35 sq.). Thereupon
the Bishop sent a Commission‚ consisting of his Suffragan and
two others. They reached Ziirich, 7 April. Next day, they first
assembled the clergy3 and then interviewed the Little Council.
By them they were referred to the Great Council: and after [No.
175] proceedings, 9 April, of which Zwingli has left an account in
his De actis le: ationis ad ngurinos missae (C. R. lxxxviii. 137 sqq),
the [No. 176 Great Council gave its decision (Egli, op. cil„
No. 236). The Bishop replied, 2 May, by a Pastoral (Opera, vii.
243) against innovations; 22 May, by an admonition (see No. 181
suffra) to the Chapter; and, 24 May, by a [No. 177] letter to the
Great Council fflgli, op. cit„ No. 251) to put them down. Mean-
while, in consequence of the Swiss defeat at La Bicocca, 27 April,
Zwingli had developed, 16 May, his attack on the pensionaries
(C. R. lxxxviii. 155 sqq.) This earned for Ziirich the hostility of
Schwyz (Opera, ΙΙ, ii. 286), and, 20 May, the Diet at Luzern
required the local authorities to prohibit their clergy from preaching
such doctrines as would unsettle ‘the common man ’ (Stierlin and
XVyss, Die Beruer- Clzronz‘k des Val. Α nslzelms, iv. 468).

11. Celibacy of clergy. Early in July, two [No. 178] petitions‚
both drafted by Zwingli, were forwarded, 2 July, to the Bishop
(C. R. lxxxviii. 189 sqq.,) and, 13 July, to 1116 Diet (zbzssd 210 sqq.,)
asking permission for the clergy to marry. Some of the signatories,
Lu 111011 (cf. Opera, vii. 210) included, had already married. They
frankly own their past to be part of 111611 plea for liberty to mar-ry
But no answer was giv;en nor, perhaps, expected. [No. 179]
Erasmus 1n a letter of 21 April t'o christopher von Uttenheim‚
Bishop of Basel, 1502-127 (Opem, ix, col. 1201, C- -F), indicated
some difficulties in the way.

III. The intercession (ff llce Saluis was the subject, 16 July,
of a [No. 180] debate between Zvvingli and Francis Lambert,
1486-†1530‚ a Franciscan of Avignon who came to Ziirich with
a letter of recommendation from Haller at Bern (Opera, vii. 206).
Zwingli, in a letter of 30 July to Beatus Rhenanus (Horawitz und
Hartfelder, Briqfwechsel des Beatus Rhenanus, No. 224), claims
that he reduced the Friar to silence : and after a second disputation,
21 July, with the Friarsl of Ziirich, he won a further victory over
their opposition by obtaining from the Burgomaster a pronounce-
ment in favour of preaching‘ from Holy Scriptme, to the exclusion
of Scotus and Thomas and suchlike’ (c. R. lxxxviii. 258; Bullinger,
Reformaliansgesclzzclzle‚ §45, edd. Ho'ttinger and Vogeli, i. 78).

Next month the Chapter set its scal to the principle which thus
lay behind the innovations by resolx mg, 19 August (Egli, op. στί,
No. 490), to ground its teaching on scripture only: while Zwingli,
22 August, in reply to the admonition which the Bishop had
addressed to the Chapter, took it up point by point in his [No.

¹ There were three orders of F riars in Ziirieh—Dominicans, Franciscans,
and Augustinians.
