xiii. 1—5 399). Adhortor primum omnium fieri obsecrationes,
orationes, interpellationes, gratiarum actiones pro omnibus
hominibus, pro regibus, et omnibus qui in sublimitate con-
stituti sunt, ut quietam et tranquillam vitam agamus cum omni
pietate et gravitate (1 Tim. ii. 1 599). Admone illos principi-
bus et potestatibus subditos esse cet. (Titus iii. 1). Subditi
estote omni humanae creaturae propter Dominum, sive regi
tamquam praecellenti, sive ducibus tamquam ab eo missis
(1 Peter ii. 13 399).
ΤΟ HUsssANDs.

Likewise, ye husbands, dwell with them according to know-
ledge, giving honour unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel
and as being heirs together of the grace of life, that your
prayers be not hindered (1 Peter iii). And be not bitter
against them (Col. iii).

To Wivsss.

Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands as unto
the Lord, even as Sarah obeyed Abraham, calling him lord,
whose daughters ye are as long as ye do well, and are not
afraid with any amazement (Eph. i, 1 Peter iii).

To PARENTs. ,
Ye fathers, provoke not your children to wrath 3 but bring
thern up in the nurture and admonition of the Lord (Eph. vi).

To CHILDREN.

Children, obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right.
Honour thy father and thy mother, which is the first command-
ment with promise, namely, that it may be well with thee,
and thou mayest live long on the earth (Eph. vi. 1, δια).

ΤΟ MENSERVANTS, MA1DSERVANTS‚ DAY-LABOURERS
AND WORKMEN.

Servants, be obedient to them that are your masters accord-
ing to the flesh, with fear and trembling, in singleness of
heart as unto Christ, not with eye-service as men—pleasers‚
but as servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the
heart, with goodwill doing service, as to the Lord, and not to
men, knowing that whatsoever good thing any man doeth,
the same shall he receive of the Lord, whether he be bond
or free (Eph. vi. 5, &c.).

To THE MAs'sER ΛΝΒ MisTREss or A HOUSEHOLD.

And, ye masters, do the same things unto them, forbear-
ing threatening, knowing that your Master also is in heaven,
nelther is there respect of persons with Him (Eph. vi. 9).
