CALVIN IN EXILE‚ 1538—41 581

elected (Opem, xxi. [= C. R. xlix.] 256), two¹ of the exiled preachers’
faction, now called Guz'llermins after Guillaume Farel, and two²
of the once ‘ patriot ⁷ but now rather Bernese faction or A rticzclanls
[Artabazum-J, so called from the articles of a treaty‚ 30 March 1539,
by which their three³ leaders, or Articulants proper, surrendered
to Bern the rights secured to Geneva under the treaty (cf. No. 267
supra, ii, ξ 4) of 7 Aug. 1536 (cf. Dunant‚ Les Relcztz'ons poliliques
de Genkve, c. ii). On 5 June 1540 1110 three who, with two4 others,
had procured the banishment of Farel and Calvin, were condemned
to death (Opem, xxi. [= C. R. xlix.] 258), and, 10 June, the remain-
ing leader of the party, Jean Philippe‚ the Captain-General, was
executed (ibid). The Guillermins thereupon, 1 July, returned to
power (ibid. 262), under the leadership of Ami Perrin : and, 21 Sept„
he was charged ‘de trouver moyeant si pourroy fere venyr
Me Caulvin ' (ibid. 265). In a letter of 22 Oct. [No. 298] the three
Councils begged Calvin to return (Herminjard, vi, No. 900).
1-Ιο was then on his way (ibid. No. 901) 10 1110 Colloquy of VVorms,
28 Oct. 1540—18 Jan. 1541, and again, 19 Feb. (ibid. vii, No. 944)
10 the Colloquy of Regemburg, 27 April—25 May 1541 (cf. his re-
port in Opera, v. [= C. R. xxxiii] 509 sqq.) z and most reluctant to
face Geneva again (Herm. vi, No. 951). But, at length, constrained
once more by Farel's ‘ thunders ' (ibid. Nos. 950, 953), threatened
by Bucer with the fate of Jonah (Opera, mxi. [= C. R.1ix.] 25),
and urged by, 4 April, [No. 299] 1110 pastors of Ziirich (Hermin-
jard, vii, No. 961), he gave in. On 13 Sept. [No. 300] Calvin re-
entered Geneva, and the discipline with him (Opera, xxi. [=
C. R. xlix] 282), ‘for that he saw how needful these bridles were,
to be put in the jaws of that city* (Hooker, Eccl. Pol„ Preface,

ii, ἓ 7)-
