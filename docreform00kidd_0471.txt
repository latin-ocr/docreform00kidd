churches ,- no ringing for the dead, and for and against the
weather3 no more blessing of palms, salt, water, and candles3
and no more bringing to any one of the last baptism or
extreme unction3 but that all such superstitions should cease
and be clean put away, inasmuch as they are all at variance
with the clear word of God.
