should learn to be loving‚ peacesul, long-suffering and harmo-
nious. This is the foundation of all the articles of the peasants
(as will be seen), who accept the Gospel and live according
to it. How then can the evil reports declare the Gospel to be
a cause of revolt and disobedience? That the authors of the
evil reports and the enemies of the Gospel oppose themselves

Ἴ to these demands is due not to the Gospel, but to the Devil‚

the worst enemy of the Gospel, who causes this opposition by
raising doubts in the minds of his followers 3 and thus the word
of God, which teaches love, peace, and concord, is overcome.
In the second place, it is clear that the peasants demand that
this Gospel be taught them as a guide in life, and they ought
not to be called disobedient or disorderly. Whether God grant
the peasants (earnestly wishing to live according to his word)

For to teach us continually the true saith will lead us to pray

and become a partos us. For if his grace work not within us,
we remain flesh and blood, which availeth nothing3 since the
Scripture clearly teaches that only through true saith can we
come to God. Only through his mercy can we become holy.
Hence such a guide and pastor is necessary, and in this sashion
grounded upon the ScriptureS.

The Second Article.—According as the just tithe is estab-
lished by the Old Testament and fulfilled in the New, we are
ready and willing to pay the fair tithe of grain. The word
of God plainly provides that in giving according to right to
God and distributing to his people the services of a pastor are
required. We will that for the future our church provost,
