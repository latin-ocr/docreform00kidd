THE PEACE OF AUGSBURG 363

Council, now resumed at Trent, 1 May 1551—28 April 1552; Fer-
dinand by his scheme for diverting the succession to the Empire
from the Austrian to the Spanish Hapsburgs; and Maurice by the
consciousness that, as he was held responsible for the imprisonment
of his relatives, the Elector and the Landgraoe, he had his
character to redeem in the eyes of Germany. Maurice changed
sides again. By the treaty of Chambord, 15 Jan. 1552 (Dumont,
Corps dzplomalz'que‚ IV. i. 31 sqq.)‚ which made over to France the
three frontier bishoprics of Mem, Toul, and Verdun, he induced

Henry 11, 1547—†59‚ to take the field in Lormine, March 1552, as
‘Protector of the liberties of Germany and its captive Princes'.
Then, 4 April, he seized Augsburg, and compelled the Emperor
to take refuge beyond the Alps at Villach in Carinthia. Charles
left it to his brother Ferdinand to arrange terms by, 2 Aug. 1552,
the Convention of Passau (Dumont‚ IV. i. 42): and, after three
more years of strife, this became the basis of an ambiguous but
lasting settlement in, 25 Sept. 1555, the Peace of Augsburg
(Brandi, Briefi’ und Aklen zur Gen-hicme des xvz''⁶¹' sallrlmnderls‚
iv. No. 671 ; translated in Emi! Reich, select Documenta* z'llztssmt·
ing Mediaeval and Modern Hz‘stmy, 230 sqq). By it Lutheranism
obtained legal recognition. True, it was a maimed victory, for
territorialism not for toleration. No subject secured religious
freedom; no Calvinist recognition. Only a lay Prince of the
Empire acquired the right to worship, and make his subjects
worship, according to the Confession of Augsburg. By the Eccle-
siastical Reservation [ξ 18 z'nsrch ifa Spiritual Prince deserted ‘the
old religion '‚ he forfeited his lands and status. Yet even this
limited victory for Cusus regio, esus relzgzb was a step gained:
the first step on the road to religious liberty.

No. 149. The Peace of Augsburg‚ 25 Sept. 1555.

ξ 15. In order to bring peace into the holy Empire of the
Germanic Nation between the Roman Imperial Majesty and
the Electors, PrinceS‚ and Estates: let neither his Imperial
Majesty nor the Electors, Princes‚ ἃς, do any violence or harm
to any estate of the Empire on account of the Augsburg
Confession‚ but let them enjoy their religious belief, liturgy
and ceremonies as well as their estates and other rights and
privileges in peace3 and complete religious peace shall be
obtained only by Christian means of amity, or under threat of
the punishment of the imperial ban.

ξ 16. Likewise the Estates espousing the Augsburg Confes-
sion shall let all the Estates and Princes who cling to the old

estates, rights and privileges,
