THE DISPUTATIONS AT ZURICH‚ 1523 409

10 August baptism was administered in the vernacular, according
to a conservative form (Opera, 11. ii. 2243 cf. Bullinger, op. cit.
11106752] [ἒὲτῇῑίᾶεέἷέἓέῗῖἒὲἒωῃῖῗᾶὶἷῗΐέἵοῗὲῑὲἕῖῗέῑξεοέἷί
additions which have no ground in the Word of God, 1525
(Opera, ΙΙ, ii. 230). On the 29th Zwingli put out a criticism
of the Mass in his [No. 193] De canone Missae Epichiresis
(Opera, iii. 83 sqq.; C, R. lxxxix. 552 sqq.). At Michaelmas the
Council issued regulations for the [No. 194] Reform of the
Great Minster (Bulhnger, op. cil. i, ξ 71 3 and Egli, Aklensamm-
luno No. 26 .

breakers (ibid. No. 421 : cf. Bullinger, op. cit. i, ξ 76) in September
began to translate his teaching into practice. The Council im-
prisoned the offenders (Opem, vii. 311 sq.) but arranged a second
Disputation. On 12 Oct. they issued their [No. 195] Summons
(Bullinger, op. cit. i, ξ 77; Zm'nglz'z‘ Opera, i. 487 sq). In reply,
the Bishop bade them, 21 Oct„ deser to the coming Diet (Strickler,
Aktenszzmmlung, i, No. 689): Schaffhausen and St. Gall alone of
the Cantons sent representatives: other districts, as [No. 196]
Obwalden (Oechsli, op. cit. i, No. 123) were scarcely polite,

Leo Jud leading the attack on Images (Bullingen i, ξ 79) and
Zwingli challenging the Mass (ibid. ς’ 80), 011 the 28th Zwingli
preached, and foreshadowed the breach with the Bishop by
contrasting true pastors with the false (Opem, i. 656 sqq.). The
Council then placed Ziirich beyond his jurisdiction: for, ignoring
their bishop, they issued 27 Oct. their [No. 198] Mandate for the
abolition of Images and of the Mass (Egli, Aklensmnmlung,
No. 4363 Bullinger, op. cil. i, ξ 82); and in it announced their
intention of sending [No. 199] Preachers of their own appointment
to convert the country districts (Opera, vii. 313 sq., and, with them,
9 Nov.‚ Zwingli’s [No. 200] ShortChristian Introduction (Opem,
i. 549 sqq„ and C. R. lxxxix. 626 sqq.)‚ to be circulated in justi-
fication of their proceedings. Some of the Chapter demurred.
They were referred by the Council to an opinion of the three
people’s-priests (Egli, Aktensammlung, No. 460, p. 183), in which
it was announced that on Christinas Day Communion would be
given in both kinds and that thenceforward expositions of Scripture
would take the place of the daily Mass. But by a (lecree of 19 Dec.
(ibid. No. 460, p. 187), the Council concedcd further discussion.
This took place (cf. llullinger, ap. cit. i, ᾗ 84) in disputations of
28 Dec. 1523 (Egli, op. cin, No. 460, p. 188, ancl No. 465), and
19—20 Jan. 1524 (ibid. Nos. 483-6, 489, and Opem, i. 584 sqq).
The Council then deferred the matter till aster Whitsuntide‚ by
which date they hoped to have consulted the Ilishops os Constance,
Chur, and Basel, the University of Basel, and the confederates.
