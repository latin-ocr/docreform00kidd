the Catholics‚ and avowing himself desirous to learn their
opinions which were not displeasing to him.

(b) From Beccatelli's sze of Contarz‘m, ξ 18.

Now the devil, who always sets himself in opposition to good
works, 5ο wrought that when this report of the peace that was
being prepared between Catholics and Protestants got about,
the enemies of the Emperor, whether in or out of Germany,
dreading the power he would obtain in the union of all
Germany, began to sow the tares of discord among the divines
of the Conference: and, on the other hand, in Rome, which
was always a land of liberty, some who saw with ill will the
greatness of the Cardinal said that he had been accepted in
Germany, because of the advances and concessions he had
made to the Lutherans, which he ought not to have made.
This was mere calumny. But with the malicious lies have
always more force than the truth: and so not only in Rome
but throughout Italy they disseminated this report. The
Cardinal, however, took as little notice of it as of a pasquinade,
when it came to his ears as far off as Germany. But he was
truly sorry that carnal envy should have interrupted the happy
progress made by the divines of the Conference.

THE FOUNDING OF THE ROMAN INQL'ISITION
Er PAUL III, 1542

Concession now gave way to repression, the policy of Contarini
to that of his colleague, Giovanni Pietro Caraffa, 1476—†1559. It
was Caraffa who had intervened to checkrnate the convention so
nearly arranged at Ratisbon. He was for reform, specially of the
spiritual life and the rnorals of the clergy, to which he contributed
by his share in the founding of the Theatines (Ranke, Popes,
Bk. ΙΙ, c. i) ε but he stood also for the maintenance of an undevia-
ting orthodoxy. What, however, the Jesuits aimed at recovering by
missions, Caraffa proposed to effect by repression: and to this end
he procured from Paul III, 21 July 1542, [No. 141] the Bull Licet
ab initio (qugrnmu Bullam'um Romanum, i. 762 sqq), establishing
the Roman Inquisition. By this weapon‚ the second in the armoury
of the Counter-Resormation (cf. Ranke, popm, Bk. ΙΙ, c. vi; and
Philippson, La Coram-7‘lvolulian relzgieuse‚ Livre 11), Caraffa
drove ‘Lutheranism ’ out os Italy ; and, as Paul IV, 1555—9‚
incarnated in Rome the severe and unbending spirit of the later
papacy (cf. Ranke, s'aficu, Bk. ΙΙΙ, c. iv: and Dixon, Hislmy Qflhe
Cllm'clz of Etzgsfwd, iv. 379 sqq).
