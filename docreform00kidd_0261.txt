XXXI
PR'OGRESS OF REFORM IN SCANDINAVIA, 1527-8

1. Denmark.—Christian II, 1513-†59‚ was no sooner defeated
in Sweden than he was driven from his own country, 13 April 1523.
His throne was offered to the Duke of Schleswig-Holstein, his
uncle, who was elected 14 April as Frederick Ι of Denmark,
1523-133. Concession was the price of his election. The King
was personally favourable to the Lutheran opinions, such as were
now being preached in the Duchies by Hermann Tast, 1490-†1551‚
at Husum, in Schleswig, since 15223 and in Jutland by Hans
Tausen, 1494—†1561‚ at Viborg from 1524· He was able to pro-
mote the preaching in his hereditary dominions by an edict of
Aug. 1524, ensuring religious liberty (Monter, Kz'rclzengeschz'chte
von Dc'z'nemark, iii. 565 ni): but in Denmark he was obliged to
defer to the Catholic magnates, who, spirituall and temporal,
united, 28 June 1524, in a pronouncement against it (ibid. iii. 153).
In 1526, however, he made Tausen his chaplain, and so exempted
him from episcopal control. The bishops remonstrated: but the
king contrived to break up their alliance with the nobles by sup·
porting the latter in their attacks upon ecclesiastical property : and
in an [No. 100] ordinance (summai-y in Miinter, iii. 207 sq.) based
upon the Recess (ibid. quormaliousgesclziclzte von Danemarle, i.
556 sqq.), 20 August 1527, of the Diet os.Odense, extended to re-
formers equality with others before the law.

ΙΙ, Sweden.—Here it was not so much the nobles as the Crown
that coveted the goods of the Church. Gustavus judged that the
time was ripe in 1527: and summoned a Diet which met at
Wester'as‚ 24 June. By the threat of resignation he reduced it to
subservience: and by the Recess put forth in its name it was
ordered by ξ 2 ‘that the surplus revenues of bishops, chapters, and
monasteries should be transferred to the Crown, which was also
provisionally to take over the bishops' castles’; by ξ 3 that ‘the
nobility might redeem from the religious houses all the land devoted
to pious uses since 1454, to which they could make good their
claims’ (R. N. Bain, Scaudsnavia, 111); and by §4 ‘that God's
Word might everywhere in the kingdom be purely preached’ (Anjou,

¹ The Danish hierarchy consisted, since 1425, of the Archbishopric of
Lund, with seven suffragans, Wiborg, Borglum, Roskilde, Odense, Ribe,
Aarhus, and Schleswig. Holstein belonged to Liibeek, in the province os
Bremen. Cf. Wiltsch, Geograplzy and Slalistz'cs os tlte (jhm-elz, ii. 287.
