idoneos fecit tarn praeclarae concordiae in tam solido funda-

. . . Postea redeundum fuit ad librum [sc. Rafisponensem}
Lectus est articulus de Ecclesia. Ibi ingens certamen ortum

nunc nostra acta Imperatori exponemus.
Habetis historiam usque ad diem Maii 23, quam aliquando
coram narrabo copiosius . . .

most necessary, there being among Christians one saith and
one church.

Monsignor Granvella talking with the Nuncio and me in
my room spoke of the infinite danger there is lest, if some
beginning be not made at once, this sect should be dis-
seminated and spread broadcast in Flanders and other
countries. He asserted to me with an oath that he had in his
hands letters of the most Christian King to the Protestant
Princes exhorting them by no means to make agreement with
