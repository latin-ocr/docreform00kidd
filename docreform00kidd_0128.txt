100 RADICALISM AT WITTENBERG, 1521—2 49

50. Quantum fieri potest in Congregationibus nostris deli-
gantur qui sint apti ad docendum verbum Dei, publice aut
privatim, reliqui victum parent Fratribus opera manuaria, quae
forma fuit veterum monasteriorum.

60. Quia moderari ceremonias et ritus omnes pro ratione
temporum ac personarum visum est, volumus ut Superioribus
suis pareant Fratres ex caritate, ut sine scandalo privatim et
publice agamus et per onmia hoc praestemus ne blasphemetur
bonurn nostrum. Amen.

N0. 50. Carlstadt’s alterations in the Mass.

(a) Letler of 26 or 27 Dec. 1521. Last Sunday Dr.
Carlstadt gave out in the parish cburch of Wittenberg that
on the coming Feast of the Circumcision . . . he would pub—
licly communicate every one who would, sub utraque specie
pam's et vt'm'3 preach a short sermon first, and then simply
pronounce the words of Consecraffion, omitting everything else.
Further, he did not intend to wear his chasuble, alb or eope at
the aforesaid Mass.

(b) On Christmas Day he preached on the Sacrament, ex-

horting the people to receive it under both kinds: After the Ι

sermon he went straight up to the altar, said the Confiteor, and
read Mass as far as the Gospel. Then he left out all the
bowings and gesticulatings with the crossings, the offering of
chalice and host‚¹ and what is called the little Canon.² The
part from the great Canon to the Consecration ³ he performed
without a cross. Omitting the Elevation, he gave communion
[of the Host] round and, as soon as he had done so, passed the
cup of the Blood of Christ round too, saying separately to each,
‘This is the cup of my blood of the new and everlasting
testament‚ the spirit and mystery of saith, which is shed for you
and for many for ‘the remission of sins.'⁴ . . . Immediately after
the distribution, he went off, and almost all the people too.
