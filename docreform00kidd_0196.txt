168 THE SPREAD OF REFORM 79

serve them in person, and administer the sacraments them-
selves or through their assistants ?

A. We rule our churches and administer the sacraments
ourselves in company with our assistants.

(3) Q. Whether they administer, or suffer to be administered,
to all laymen the sacrament both of the body and of the blood
of Christ?

A. To all who desire it, we administer the entire sacrament
as Christ ordained it and as our conscience also requires us to
administer it.

(4) Q. Whether all who receive the sacrament are exhorted
to confession and repentance of all sins?

A. We exhort no one to auricular confession: but we allow
our assistants to give a Christian exhortation before the re-
ception of the sacrament, regardless of whether a man makes
his private confession or not.

(5) Q. Why they have changed the long-standing usage of
the Mass by having Gospel and Epistle read in German?

A. We have Gospel and Epistle read in German, and
(the Prior) I have the whole Mass in German, so that the
bystanders may understand.

(6) Q. Why they baptize children in German, and omit the
established custom of the Church?

A. We baptize children in our own tongue and have not
hitherto omitted any ancient custom.

(7) Q. Whether they have themselves, or through their
assistants, taught the people that the sacrament of unction
ought not to be administered?

A. When the sick have asked for unction, we have had it
administered to them: but we have neither enjoined nor for-
bidden it.

(8) Q. Whether they have forbidden or suffered to be for-
bidden Vigils, Masses and Years'-minds to be celebrated for
the departed?

A. We have given up holding Vigils and Masses for the
dead : and if a person desires such, we decline to permit it.

(9) Q. Whether they admit marriages which are lawfully
forbidden ,- and grant divorce on their own authority?

A. What is forbidden by God in the third book os Moses,
we do not admit3 but as to what is forbidden of man, while
we grant no divorce, we admit it always, if they require it.
F urther, we grant no divorce in the case of a lawful marriage 3
since what God hath joined together, man may not put asunder.
