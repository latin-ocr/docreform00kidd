neque enim cum Franco, neque cum Caesare quicquam
commune habemus praeter ceteros mortales, nisi unicum
Christum, qui nescio quam sit illis cordi, dum coelum terrae
miscent, et onmia tumultibus et caedibus implent. Salvere
iube nostro nomine amicum nostrum Trempum, Sebastianum,1
Valerium,2 medicos hunc corporum illum animorum, Thomam
Vittembachium, carissimum praeceptorem nostrum, si quando
ad vos concesserit, et omnia boni consule. Opto te, frater in
Christo, valere.

THE BEGINNINGs0F THE REFORMATION IN
ZURICH, 1522

Luther and Zwingli have much in common: but, ‘while‚ in the
one case, we see the highest and most august powers of the world

Council, in reliance upon a twofold principle (α) that they, not the
Ordinary, had authority in things spiritual, and (b) that the Bible
and the Bible only was the standard both of doctrine and of practice.
A typical statement of this [No. 170] principle of the Reforma-
tion in Ziirich occurs in Zwingli's Subsidium de Euclearz‘sti'a
of 1525 (Opera, iii. 339). ln 1522 it served to settle three questions,
fasting, the celibacy of the clergy‚ and the intercession of the
saints. It thus acquired public recognition. The Pope made no
sign but in Zwingli's favour (see No. 187 z‘nfra): for even with
Adrian VI, 9 Jan. 1522—†14 Sept. 1523, Zwingli's heresy was of
less importance than his possible influence in procuring recruits.
‘We are not reproached as heretics and apostates,' wrote Zwingli,
‘but lauded with high titles' (Opera, II. ii. 393). The breach in
Z'tirich was with the Bishop.

Ι. Faslz‘ng. On Ash Wednesday, 5 March 1522, emboldened
by Zwingli’s preaching (cf. Egli, Aktensammlung, No. 213) of the
previous year [No. 171] certain citizens broke the fast (ibim,
No. 233). They defended themselves, some by [No. 172] street-
fighting (z'bz'd., No. 232), others, including [No. 173] the publisher
Christopher Froschauer‚ 1519—†64, by pleading press of work
and the authority of Zwingli (ibid, No. 234). On 23 March Zwingli
came to their aid with [No. 174] a sermon, published 16 April,
