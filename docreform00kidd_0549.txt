CALVIN, TO HIS ARRIVAL IN GENEVA, 1509-36

John Calvin (cf. Calvini Opera, xxi [=C0rpus Reformalormn
xlix] containing ‘Lives ’ by Beza and Colladon, both 1564, and the
Annales Calvinianz' by the editors: and Williston XValken solm
Calvin) was born at Noyon, in Picardy, 10 July 1509. His father
was a notary in the ecclesiast-ical court, an official of bishop and
of chapter; able, therefore, to give his son a superior education and
alive to the advantage of it. Calvin‚ though by birth ‘unus de
plebe homuncio’ (Op. ν. [= C. R. xxxiii] 5), was, as he afterwards
wrote to a friend of the noble house of Montrnor‚ ‘domi vestrae
puer educatus, iisdem tecum studiis initiatus ’ (ibid. 8). When
barely twelve‚ he received, aster the manner of the day, a benefice,
19 May 1521, in the Cathedral by way of endowment for study:
and, Aug. 1523, he went ‘gustatis duntaxat latinae linguae rudi-
mentis' (Ep. 1345 3 Op. xiii. [= C. [ι’. xli] 525) to the Universityof
Paris. Here he began grammar and rhetoric at the College de la
Marche under the huinanist Mathurin Cordier‚ 1479-†1564‚ ‘ cuius
ductu in litterarum stadium ingressus huc saltem usque progressus
sum ut ecclesiae Dei aliquid prodessem' (ibim). But he was with
cordier ⁴ ad exiguum tempus ’ (s'lzz‘d.) only ; sor next year he went on,
for philosophy and dialectic‚ to the College de Montaigu, where
(Herminjard, ii, No. 310, n. 7) by the end of 1527 he would have
graduated in Arts. Early in 1528, ‘pour obeir a mon pere’ (Op.
xxxi. [= C. R. lix.] 22) he turned to Law; and, in pursuit of it,
went tirst to Orleans to attend the lectures of the conservative Pierre
de l'Estoile‚ 1480—†1537‚ and thence, 1529, to Bourges. Hither he
was attracted by the fame of Andrea Alcimi, 1493—†1550‚ more of
an innovator3 and Calvin's first appearance in print was the pre-
face to a friend's defence of l'Estoile (Herminjard, ii, No. 328 : Op.
ix. [=C. R. xxxvii] 785). Here too, he began Greek with (Ep. 814 ;
Op. xii. [= C. R. xl.] 364) the German humanist Melchior Wolrnar,
1496-†1561. The death of his father, 26 May 1531 (Herminjard,
ii, No. 366, n. 4), released him frorn the Law; and, 19 June, he was
back in Paris, free sor other studies there since, by 14 Feb. 1532,
