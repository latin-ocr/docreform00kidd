end of our coming thither is not to make protestation that we
are upright or just in our lives, but contrariwise‚ we come to
seek our life and perfection in Jesus Christ, acknowledging in
the mean time that we of ourselves be the children of wrath
and damnation

Let us consider, then, that this Sacrament is a singular
medicine for all poor sick creatures, a comfortable help to weak
souls, and that our Lord requireth no other worthiness on our
part, but that we unfeignedly acknowledge our naughtiness and
imperfection. Then, to the end that we may be worthy par-
takers of His merits‚ and most comfortable benefits, which is
the true eating of His flesh and drinking of His blood, let us
not suffer our minds to wander about the consideration of these
earthly and corruptible things (which we see present to our
eyes, and feel with our hands), to seek Christ bodily present
in them, as if He were enclosed in the bread and wine, or as if
these elements were turned and changed into the substance of
His flesh and blood 3 for the only way to dispose our souls to
receive nourishment, relies, and quickening of His substance,
is to lift up our minds by saith above all things worldly and
sensible‚ and thereby to enter into heaven, that we may find
and receive Christ, where He dwelleth undoubtedly very God
and very Man, in the incomprehensible glory of His Father‚ to
Whom be all praise, honour, and glory, now and ever. Amen.

O FATHER of mercy, and God of all consolation, seeing all
creatures do acknowledge and confess 'l'hee as Governor and
Lord, it becometh uS, the workmanship of Thine own hands,
at all times to reverence and magnify Thy godly Majesty, first,
for that Thou hast created us to Thine own image and simili-
tude, but chiefly because Thou hast delivered us from that
everlasting death and damnation into the which Satan drew
mankind, by the mean of sin, from the bondage whereof
neither man nor angel was able to make us free, but Thou, O
Lord, rich in mercy, and infinite in goodness, hast provided
our redemption to stand in Thine only and well-beloved Son,
whom of very love Thou didst give to be made Man like unto
us, in all things, sin except, that in His body He might receive
the punishment of our transgression, by His death to make
