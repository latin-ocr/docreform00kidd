122 THE NEW ECCLESIASTICAL SYSTEM, 1523—4 63

598 sqq.: cf. de Wette‚ ii. 379 sqq), and at Easter he put out
a treatise contending That a Christian congregation or community
(Gemeinde) lias ille right . . . to . . . appoint and remove toachers
for itself apart from the bishop ( Werke‚ xxii. 140 sqq„ ed. Erlangen,
1826—57). This was to anticipate counsel which in his [No. 65]
De instituendis ministris (Op. Lat. vi. 494 sqq.)‚ he had given,
by N ov. (ibid. 492 n. 1), to the Bohemian Utraquists, to forgo their
requirement of ‘episcopal ordination’ and ‘choose their pastors
themselves ’ (Ranke, Refformation, 459). At VVhitsuntide appeared
his essay On tlte order of divine service in the congregation (Werke,
xxii. 151 sqq„ ed. Erlangen) with its challenge to ‘ omit everything
rather than the VVord ' (156) : and this was followed in December
by [No. 66] the Formula Missae et Communionis (Op. Lat. vii.
1 sqq), addressed to Nicholas Hausmann, pastor of Zwickau,
1521-32. Here he touched upon the need of German hymns (ibid.
16), and proceeded to meet it by contributing to the earliest evan-
gelical hymn—books of 1524. To the W'ltenberger Achtlz’ederbuch
he contributed four hymns, to the Effnrter Enchiridion eighteen
out of twenty-five, and to the Chorgesangbiiclzlein twenty-four out
of thirty-two. Of his thirty-six hymns twenty-four are traced to
1523—4: the most famous [No. 67], Ein’ feste Burg ist unser
Gott, to 1527 (tr. Carlyle, Essays, iii. 82 ed. 1872). On this recon-
struction see Daniel, Codex LilnrgicuS, ii. 1—112 : Rietschel‚ op. cit.
i. 396 sqq„ and Kidd, Conl. qu„ 42 sqq.

No. 63. Luther's notice of the substitution of
weekly for daily Mass, 11 March, 1523.

Post hunc sermonem locutus est de missa abroganda, ne
scilicet singulis diebus haberetur missa sed solum dominicis,
nisi quispiam participare velit mensae Domini in septima, tunc
celebrandam missam dicebat. Item addidit de ordinatione
servanda ut clerus et scholastici singulis diebus convenirent
duas horas mane et vesperi, ut mane liber Novi Testamenti
legeretur ac interpretaretur, vesperi Veteris Testamenti 5 sed hoc
se nolle incipere aiebat sed tanturn proponere.
