vi PREFATORY NOTE

will be welcome to a wider audience than the lecturer
and the class for whom the volume was originally in-
tended. We have been advised, of late, not to ignore
our differences, but to study them. To do this, we must
study not origins only, but developments. Origins are
common ground. Developments mark the points of
divergence. Such developments it has been also part
of my object to trace3 not so much for their own sake,
as because they have become origins in their turn.

I have to thank the Dean of Canterbury for permission
to print Nos. 35 and 97 from his edition of Lnther’s
Primam lVorks, and No. 107 from his essay in Clmrclz
and Fac'tlt (1890) ; Rev. T. B. &Villson for the translation
of No,131; Miss Nora'n Leeson for that of No. 1173
and my friend, Rev. F. E. Brightman, Fellow of Mag-
dalen College‚ for reading my proofs. But I am under
special obligations ‘so the Delegates of the Press for
procuring me the keen but kindly criticism of Mr. C. R. L.
Fletchen formerly Fellow of All Souls and Magdalen
College'sssand of Mr. P. S. Allen, Fellow of Merton

College.
