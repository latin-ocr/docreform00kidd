104 RADICALISM AT WITTENBERG, 1521—2 53

God had hidden it from them, as the Lord Jesus himself says
in Matt. xi [2 5] and Luke x [21].. .Besides, these three
persons began not only to storm against schools‚ but also
against churches and images in churches, that they would
cast these images out of the churches. And they gave out
that no learned man should be allowed as preacher or priest
in the churches‚ but laymen and handicraftsmen, who were
only able to read, as Ι 113νο known many such persons who
wished to be called and chosen to the office.

No. 54. Luther on his eight sermons of
9-16 March.
