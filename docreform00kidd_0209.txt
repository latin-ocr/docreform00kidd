THE DIET OF SPEIER, 1526

Alarmed by the Peasants’ Revolt, George Duke of Saxony united
at Dessau, 19 July 1525, with the Electoral brothers Albert of Mainz‚
†1545‚ and. Joachim of Brandenburg‚ †1535‚ and the two Dukes
Eric of Brunswick-Calenberg, 1495-†1540‚ and Henry of Brunswick-
Wolfenbiittel, 1514—†1568, to ‘extirpate the root os this disturbance,
the damned Lutheran sect' (W. Friedensburg, Zur Vmgesclzz'clcle
des Galba-Torgauz‘sclten Bz't'ndm'sses, Eeilage 1, 113). Early in
1526 Duke Henry went to secure the Emperor's support, which was
promised in his admonition of 23 March 1526 (Neudecker‚ Urknnden
aus der Reformationszez's, No. 5).

Thus menaced the Elector and the Landgrave drew together,
27 Feb. 1526, in Gotha (Friedensburg, 105). Their alliance was
ratified 2 May, as the League of Torgau (Dumont, Corps diploma-
tique, IV. i. 449 sqq.); and was then expanded at Magdeburg by
the admission‚ 12 June, of Philip Duke of Brunswick-Grubenhagen,
1486-†1551, Dukes Otto, †1549, Ernest, †1546, and Francis, †1549,
of Brunswick-Liineburg, Henry Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin,
1503—†1552‚XR⁷olfgang Prince of Anhalt-Kothen, 1508-1562, and
the Counts Gebhardt, †1558, and Albert, †1560, of Mansfeld (ibid.
455 sq.), and, 25 June, of the city of Magdeburg (ibid. 457 sq.).

Sides were thus taken when it became known, 24 June (Friedens-
burg, Der Rez’clzstag su spelm 268) 11131 hythe [No. 87] League of
Cognac, 22 May (Dumont, ila. 451 sqq), the Emperor was again at
variance with the Pope. Next day the Diet opened‚ 25 June, under
the presidency of Ferdinand, with [No. 88] the Proposition (Frie-
densburg, Reiclzstag stc Speier, Anhang Vl. 523 sqq). The old project
of a common programme of reforms reappeared, for the last time,
14 July, in the report of a committee of the Princes (Ranke, Rey‘.
423 sq. and Friedensbmg, 349, n. Ι). 115 adoption might have
secured a Germany united by means of a national assembly‚ had
not parties now taken too definite a shape sor this. Ferdinand cut
short the discussion by producing, 1 Aug„ instructions dated from
Seville 23 March (Frieclensburg, 371, n. 2) 111 which the Emperor
forbade innovations, promised to arrange with the Pope for a Council‚
and demanded the execution of the Edict of W'orms. Thereupon
[N o. 89] the Cities declared‚4Aug.‚ that such a course was impossible
(Friedensburg‚ Anhang XI. 552 sqq.) ; and as it proved equally im-
practicable to execute the Edict in the Evangelical States and to
repeal it in the Catholic‚ the Diet, at the suggestion of the Princes,
7 Aug. (Mica, Anhang XII. 556), fell back by its [No. 90] Recess
of 27 Aug. (Walch‚ Lutlzers Schriften, xvi, col. 268, No. 809, §4)
on Territorialism as the only remaining alternative. Its decision
was hastened by the advance of the Turk. On 23 April Solyman‚
1520-†66, marched out of Constantinople and overthrew Louis 11,
Kin6g of Bohemia and Hungary, 1516-126, 31 Momm, 29 Aug.
