190 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 92 l

5. Henceforward no processions shall be held, for they have
no ground in God's W ord.

6. Henceforward no ringing nor singing nor Masses nor Vigils ,y

for the dead are to be held: for they are of no use, and of no
avail.

7. Henceforward no water, salt, ashes, palms‚ tapers, greenery,
and the like are to be hallowed : for it is all nonsense and no
good.

8. There are to be no obsequies and celebrations for the
dead, and no prayers for them. For they are in God's hand
and judgement.

9. There are to be no more orders, neither monks nor nuns 3
but only such Orders as war against unbelievers and heathen‚
like the Teutonic Order.¹

10. Bishops shall continue and remain; not anointing-bishops
nor ordaining-bishops‚ but such as preach and teach and
expound the pure word of God and preside over the Church.

1 1. Henceforward there are to be no superstitious distinctions
made of days and seasons, with all sorts of F east Days, Fridays,
Saturdays, Ember Days, Fast Days, and so 0n3 but every day
alike shall be the Lord's Day‚ for eating flesh or fish as every
man likes or finds necessary, or according as the good God
may bestow it.

12. Easter, Whitsuntide, and Christmas, together with Sun-
days, are to be kept in Christian fashion, as is conformable to
God’s Word and order. Other such Holy Days as are not
grounded in God's W ord and keep men from their daily work
and calling are sheer nonsense and fabIes, and conduce to bad
example.

10. Hymns and pray ers in church are to be in German, so
that every man may understand. Salve re0 <rma is not to be sung,
for it conduces to God's dishonour. Holy Baptism is to be
administered 1n German, without chrism and oil.

14. Tithes are not to be given to priests who do not serve
their office, but those who minister at the altar are to be paid
from the altar.

15. In no church shall the Consecrated Bread be reserved
nor taken for God's Body except at the Communion, according
to Christ⁷ s institution, nor carried about.

16. Pictures m houses and churches are not to be prayed to,
nor to have any candles lit before them.
