52 RADICALISM AT WITTENBERG, 1521-2 103

et aliunde probare debent atque non possunt. Quod ergo non
est contra Scripturam‚ pro Scriptura est, et Scriptura pro eo. . . .

Sed plura coram. Semper exspectavi Satanam‚ ut hoc ulcus
tangeret, sed noluit per Papistas. In nobis ipsis et inter nostros
molitur hoc gravissimum schisma, verum Christus conteret eum
velociter sub pedibus nostris. Volo etiam scire ut tractaris
illud, 1 Cor. vii [14] : ‘ alioqui filii vestri immundi essent,
nunc autem sancti sunt.' . . . Nam hinc parvulos fuisse bapti-
zatos ritu et tempore Apostolorum, optarim ostendi. . . .

No. 53. The Confusion at Wittenberg.

(a) Letter of 25 san. 1522. I would have you know that
the University and the Town Council have agreed upon the
way in which Mass should be celebrated in the parish church
to which we all belong. First will come the hymn with the
Introit, Gloria in excelsis, Episde, Gospel, and Sanctus. T hen
follows the sermon, and afterwards the Mass as our God and
Lord Jesus instituted it in coena. The priest speaks the verba
consecrationzlv aloud in German, and admonishes the people
that to every one who feels the burden of sin and hungers and
thirsts after God's grace, the body and blood of the Lord
will be administered. When the people have communicated‚
Agnus Dei, Carmen [v. l. Commzmd] and Benedl'camus
Domino are sung. The Canon has been upset. For the
future we will tolerate no beggar, be he monk or no. 'l'he
poor shall be provided for from the common purse. . . . They
will not endure images in church, and in time will remove them.
Strong passages of Scripture are alleged against them. . . .

(b) Fro'kclzel’s Preface. These three men² give out that no
one should study or keep school, for Christ has forbidden all
' this in Matthew xxiii [8] with these words, ‘Be not ye called
Rabbi' or masters. In consequence of this many men of
talent about this time left this place and forsook their studies,
who might have been useful to their country and countrymen.
Dr. Carlstadt went round to the houses of the townsmen, and
asked them how they understood this or that passage in this or
that prophet. And when the simple townsmen wondered at
his question and said to him, ‘Sir Doctor, how comes it that
you learned men and doctors in Holy Scripture thus ask us
poor, illiterate‚ unlearned folk such questions? Ye should
rather tell us the meaning,' then Carlstadt answered them that

¹ sc. Commlmz'o.
² Carlstadt, Zwilling, and George Molir, the schoolmaster.
