368 SWITZERLAND IN 1513 150

each envoy has received a copy of the articles aforesaid to bring
the same before his Sovereign and Lord, to advise there0n‚ and
at the Diet appointed to be held again here in Baden at the
inn on the Sunday after St Verena's day next [5 Sept.]· in
the evening,f1nally to answer and conclude the matter, seeing
that as the ambassadors are of opinion the business may brook
no further delay.—Resolved, to bring up, at the Diet appointed,
all instruments‚ new and old, hitherto occurring between the
Dukes of Milan and our Confederafion, so that they may be
looked into and a conclusion come to as to what seems most
suitable sor present relations.'

(j) An embassy from the Signory of Venice applied for a.
league with us. We answered that we were in alliance with his
Imperial Majesty3 and that since he and Venice had some
differences with each other, we could not, till these were settled,
enter into an alliance with Venice. But we offered our media-
tion, and the Imperial Ambassadors undertook to bring this
offer to the notice of their Master, and to give us a reply at the
next Diet. The Venetian envoys might therefore report our
intention to their Signory, · and, as soon as we had the consent
of both parties, we would with all speed get to work Should
the attempt succeed‚ Venice might obtain a reply in terms
favourable to the alliance

No. 151. The League with Appenzen, 17 Dec. 1513.

With unimportant differences follows, almost word for word,
the League with Schaffhausen. It opens with the mention, as
contracting partieS, of :—

‘We‚ the Burgomasters‚ Bafliffs, Magistrates, Councillors‚
Burgesses, People and whole Communes [Gemeinden] of
Ztirich, Bern, Luzern, Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden above and
below the Forest, Zug with the outer district thereto belong-
ing, Glarus, Basel, Freiburg, Solothurn‚ and Schaflhausen on
the one part: and we, the High Bailiff, Council, People and
whole Commune of Appenzell on the other . . . '

In the article defining the assistance to be rendered, the
liabilities of the Confederation are limited, in the case of the
Appenzellers, by the following supplement :—

‘ And though [the Confederation] shall be under no obliga-
tion to render us [Appenzellers] any assistance but within the
borders of our own territory, they shall do that gladly.'
