232 THE ORGANIZATION OF THE 99

stand a Church-Chest in the sacristy, wherein the overseers or
Treasurers ² shall place the alms of their church, as follows 2-

Memorials founded at the church, kalends, and what are
called benefactorum, and all benefices shall, as they become
vacant, be placed therein. The register and all that they shall
receive, in whatever wise and from what source so ever, shall
by the Honourable Council be handed over to the Treasurers.
They shall have power over all church goods‚ as hitherto
churchwardens have had, and shall bring them into their
Common Chests.. ..To these chests shall also belong the
Ember-penny. Wherefore the preachers shall from the pulpit
diligently require the Ember-penny of the people, on the
Sunday before the offering—day. . . . We doubt not too that
the worshipful Guilds and Brotherhoods will bring into these
Chests all that hitherto they have spent upon candles, memo·
rials, vigils, and Masses for the dead in church. Item, absentee
holders of benefices shall bring into these Chests all that
formerly they gave in fees to the celebrant for reading Mass:
and, further, whatever they provided in the way of wine and
oblations for the Sacrifice shall also be placed therein. Item,
whatever in any parish the council of the district, may devote
thereto and whatever else may be arranged with the parish
priest, shall be for the good of this Chest. . .. For these Church-

Chests four deacons or overseers shall be appointed by the Ἀ

Council and the members of the Commune who shall collect
and demand all that is ordered, answer for everything, and give
receipts for themselves and their successors. And for this
purpose they shall have a ledger wherein all necessary things
shall be entered and duly kept.

These deacons or treasurers shall pay the stipends to the
preachers of their churches every quarter‚ as also to the
sacristans and the organists. They shall also provide and
maintain a dwelling near the church for their preacherS, and,
where they are willing and able to do so, for their schoolmaster
who is appointed in their church to sing with the children, in
case he wishes to marry and to keep house. . . . They shall
also keep the churches in repair and provide what is. needful
therein. These four persons shall have authority from the
Commune in company with the Council to appoint a preacher‚
as is above set down, one of the four being a member of the
Council. . . ,Τ hese four treasurers shall reckon up year by year
