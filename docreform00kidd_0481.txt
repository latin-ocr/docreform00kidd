taught better from the Word of God by you and yours. Other-
wise, I abide by my opinion, for to that Ι arn constrained by
the command of Christ, the Word, faith, truth, judgement,
conscience. Testify to the truth 3 you can in no way ofsend
me. I am a man, and can fall, since that is human, but from
my heart I desire to rise again. Write me whether the promise
in Matt. xix. 14, ‘ Suffer little children to come unto me,⁷ διο,
specially belongs to infants. What prompts nie to that is the
word of Christ, ‘for of such is the kingdom of heaven‚' not ·' of
them’. Ι have sent letters to Zwingli by the captain of our
volunteers. Instead of baptism, Ι cause the church to come
together, bring the infant in, explain in German the Gospel,
‘They brought little children, &c.,’ then a name is given him,
the whole church prays for the child on bended knees and
commends him to Christ that He will be gracious and intercede
for him. But if the parents are still weak, and positively wish
that the child be baptized, then Ι baptize it 3 and I am weak
with the weak, for the time being, until they are better in-
structed. As to the Word, however, Ι do not yield to them
in the least point. . . .'

some have accordingly neglected to have their children
baptized, our Lords the Burgomastcr‚ Council, and Great
Council‚ have had a disputation held about this matter to learn
what Holy Scripture has to say about it. As they have learned
from it that, notwithstanding this error, children should be
baptized as soon as they are born, all those therefore who have
hitherto allowed their children to remain unbaptized, must
have them baptized within the next week : and whosoever will
not do this, must with wife and child, goods and chattels, leave
our city, jurisdiction, and dominions, or await what will be done
with him. Every one will accordingly know how to conduct
himself. . . .

san. 21.--(1) To the preceding resolution (Egli, No. 621)
about Baptism‚ it is now added that ‘ the special disputations
arranged to deal with such matters' are to be put away: in
particular, Conrad Grebel and Felix Manz are to abstain from
