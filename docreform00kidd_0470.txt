had done nothing ’‚ all five had to be brought up before the
Burgomaster and Council for the execution of the mandates,
sentences, and decisions issued. ‘Otherwise let men believe
05 they will. If they do [as ordered], my Lords will be the
more gracious to them. But if they do it not, and afterwards
are found in the city and on their benefices, then they will
be put out of their benefices and shown the way out of the
city? ν

No. 202. The Council’s defence of its proceedings,
21 March 1524.

At the end of their answer they say, ‘In all that is possible
for us and to which we are bound, as becomes pious members
of the Confederation, we shall be glad to comply with your
requests‚ and to wait upon you according to our bounden
duty. But in what concerns the Word of God, our souls'
salvation and our consciences, we cannot give way. . . .'

No. 203. The puttinjg down of relies and organs,
une 1524.

At the Great Minster in Ziirich were shrines called the
shrines of the blessed martyrs Felix and Regula. And as the
common people were for it, the bodies of the blessed martyrs
were kept and buried therein. But the honourable Council
and the Citizens also ordered at 11115 111110, 111 June, that they
should be put thence and out of the church: and, should
there be any corpses 111010111, they should be honourably and
quietly interred, or secretly dispersed in the bone house. . . .
