V.-HOW THE SIMPLE FOLKS SHOULD BE
TAUGHT TO CONFESS.

Confession consists of two parts: first, to confess our sins,
and secondly‚ to receive the absolution or forgiveness bestowed
by the confessor, as from God Himself‚ and not to doubt
thereos, but firmly to believe that our sins are thereby for-
given in the sight of God in heaven.

What sins should we confess?

To God we are to confess all sins, even those that ive do
not recognize, as we do in the Lord's Prayer ,· but to the con-
fessor we are only to confess such sins as we know and feel
guilty ofin our hearts.

Which are they? ι

Examine thyself according to the Ten Commandments‚
whether thou art father, mother, son, daughter, master, mistress,
manservant or maidservant‚ and see if thou hast been dis-
obedient, unfaithful, and idle, whether thou hast done any one
an injury by word or deed, whether thou hast been dishonest,
negligent, slothful, or hast otherwise caused harm. ⁸

[pray thee, friend, lell me a slzort form of confession.

Auswer. Say thus to thy confessor: Worthy reverend
master, Ι pray you hear my confession, and declare absolu-
tion to me for God's sake.

Say thus: I, a poor sinner, confess myself guilty of all
sins before God, in particular Ι confess to you that Ι am a
manservant or a maidservant, &c., but, alas! I serve my
master unfaithfully, for at such and such a time Ι have not
done what they bade me, but angered them and moved them to
swear ς Ι have neglected my work and caused damage 3 Ι have
been froward in word and deed ,- Ι have been angry with my
fellows, sullen to my wife, and I have sworn at her. All this I
repent of, and I pray for mercy, and will seek to amend.

A master or mistress must say as follows :—

Especially Ι acknowledge to you that I have not faithfully
trained my children and servants and my wife to the glory
of God; Ι have sworn, and given a bad example with un-
chaste words and deeds; I have done injury to my neigh-
bour, spoken ill of him, sold too dear, given short measure and
false weight—and whatever else he may have done contrary
to the commandments of God and his state in life.
